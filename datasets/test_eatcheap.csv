Whey protein can still be a dollar a scoop (rice protein so much cheaper per gram protein, but again extra calories to get there).


If I add 4 liquid egg whites to supplement my 2 normal eggs (because too many eggs and the fats take me over my goal caloric intake), that’s an added dollar right there per meal (I have to admit I hate wasting food, so I buy the egg whites in a carton).  


I try to make a nice chili meal, but does it seem to anyone else that meat prices have gone up?  $15 for 6 meals/12 servings there, so it looks like I’m spending $1.25 on meat per serving - assuming my husband doesn’t eat 2 servings at once, which is difficult to pull off.

We have a large van for storage and could make something every Sunday, however don’t have a freezer system or anything to help it keep. 

Currently, we do in the morning - yogurt pots, oat pots, warmed waffles, bagels, crumpets and guacamole. This is very popular!

In the evening we normally do - flatbreads stuffed with meat, cheese, homemade chilli jam, etc, and then a roast pepper vegan option as well. 

We basically use two large planche grills to do all our cooking, and do stuff requiring specialist equipment is not possible, unless it’s worth it in which case we can buy whatever is necessary “.

Also I&amp;#39;d like to keep my macros the same:- around 410 calories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this together quickly as I don&amp;#39;t know how to cook and don&amp;#39;t wanna spend a lot of time on it. So I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get into complex cooked ingredients. Some simple cooking might be ok though. Also, I can&amp;#39;t make my own dressing. I can switch for other store bought dressings though. Thanks for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl,Dr: How do you make the best egg salad with the above listed ingredients with minor changes or additions?&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend and I recently started cooking all our meals together, and we're trying to be as healthy as possible while keeping our monthly grocery bill as low as possible. Typically for a cheap but filling meal I would do a variation on rice and beans, or some kind of curry with chick peas--since meat is expensive, it helps the budget a lot to have a few vegetarian meals a week. 

Unfortunately, the boyfriend is allergic to every vegetarian protein I can think of-- all nuts and legumes, so no beans or chick peas. Also soy and sesame, which rules out a lot of sauces. 

We mostly eat chicken, pork, and ground beef as our sources of protein. Our meal plans have good variety, but the grocery bill is a little higher than we'd like. Are there other cheaper-than-chicken proteins I don't know about? Or are we stuck with chicken for every meal if we want to be as cheap as possible?

It's a quick and easy take on beef, potatoes and mushroom gravy.

Apologies in advance because my cooking style is mainly ""how many people do I need to feed tonight"" rather than set quantities. 

**One Pan Beef and Potatoes**

Notes: 

* I usually make this with ground beef, but it works equally well with cheap cuts of beef.           
* If you normally stretch your ground beef with fillers, do it here. I stretch with 1/2 cup cracker crumbs (or 1/4 cup dried bread crumbs) and 1 egg per pound of beef..and keep in mind that this will get you about 1 extra patty per pound of meat.        
* This recipe works for anything from 2-6 servings. If you're making more, increase water, bullion and Worcestershire sauce to make more gravy.       

Start with **1/3 lb of ground beef per person**. For this recipe, any fat content works. Mix ground beef with **salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce** to taste. Make thick 1-inch patties. 

If using any other cheap cut of beef, plan for 1/3 pound per person. Cut your beef into serving portions, up to 1 inch thick. 

In a large and very hot skillet, sear your meat. Use a little butter if you need more fat. Don't worry about cooking it through, just get a good sear on the meat. Remove from pan. (You want a fairly large plate to rest the meat, because you'll be adding to it.) 

Add **1 medium potato per person, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces** to pan. Brown the outsides. Again, don't worry about cooking through. Just get a decent crust on the outside. Remove from pan and add to your resting plate. 

Turn the heat down to medium-high and add **1/4 of a small onion, thinly sliced, per person** to the pan. Saute until onion starts to brown. 

Add **2-3 sliced mushrooms per person** and cook until the mushrooms release all their liquid and start to brown. 

Move onions and mushrooms to one side. Add a **knob of butter** to empty side of skillet. When melted sprinkle with **2-3 tablespoons of flour**. Stir to make a roux, until flour browns, about 1-2 minutes. 

Slowly pour in **2 cups of water**, about a 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add **2 beef bullion cubes** and **2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce**. Stir,incorporating mushrooms and onion, until gravy starts to bubble. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. 

Turn heat to low. Put the potatoes and meat back in the skillet. Cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until potatoes are tender and meat is cooked. 

Optional: Add frozen green peas or frozen carrots for the last 5 minutes. Or cook separately and serve on the side.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my go-to when I&amp;#39;m tired of casseroles and stir-fry.

**Pan-roasted chickpeas:**

Chili Oil (I just grabbed some Thai Chilies from the farmers market this summer and popped them in some veg oil)

2 cloves of garlic $0.08

1 can of chickpeas $0.99

Splash of white wine vinegar

Salt

Finish with sesame oil 

Heat the chili oil, lightly toast the garlic in the oil to infuse, add chickpeas, a splash of vinegar, salt and saute until hot and a little crispy. Remove from pan and finish with sesame oil. I also take the skin off my chickpeas because I prefer the texture but that's a totally unnecessary and timely process; feel free to omit. 

**Fried rice**

1 c. rice $0.28

1/4 onion $0.23

Carrot $0.15 (I used a purple carrot I grew in my garden but any carrot will do)

Red pepper $2.50 (I grew this in my garden as well but added a cost just cause)

A couple handfuls of frozen peas $0.68

Salt 

**Sauce**

about 1/3 c. soy sauce, about 1/3 c. Thai peanut sauce, couple teaspoons of chili garlic sauce, a good squirt of sriracha, a good squirt of hoisin (or powdered MSG). 

I don't like crunchy onions so I saute my onion in some chili oil and remove them from the pan. Get the pan really hot, add more chili oil, then the rice so it gets nice and crispy, option to add 2-3 eggs at this stage. Make a well in the middle of the rice, add your onions, carrot, pepper, peas, and a good crack of salt. Stir frequently until hot and veggies are still crunchy but kinda softened. Spoon into bowls and top with the chickpeas.

Crunchy oven roasted granola is great but requires a fair amount of effort to make.  Often I'm in a hurry in the morning and if I don't have proper toasted granola on hand I'll make something similar in the microwave.  It won't be toasted and crunchy like oven granola but rather firm and chewy.

Base recipe:

- 1/3 cup rolled oats
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- a pinch of salt
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1 tsp vegetable oil

1. Mix all ingredients together in a microwave safe bowl.
2. Microwave the oat mix on high for 2 minutes.
3. Remove from microwave and stir everything up really well.  (I also usually move the ingredients to the edges of the bowl, in a donut shape, at this point because my microwave seems to have a hot spot in the middle of the turntable.)
4. Microwave the oats for another 1.5 to 2 minutes.
5. Add a little milk and eat immediately before it gets soggy.

You can certainly add all kinds of other typical granola ingredients (nuts, seeds, coconut, etc) according to your taste but it's pretty good even in just the base form.  If you want to use honey instead of brown sugar you'll probably want to eliminate the same amount of water.  This simple form of granola is also nice to sprinkle on yogurt.

Good news:  I saw a recipe idea that u/skippityspood posted in a $20/week thread and fell in love with it.  I made it and it tastes like the freakin' bomb.  I added turmeric and garam masala and hhhhhhhnnnnnggggg it's so good.  There's also chicken broth in there but I didn't include it.

Bad news:  I was on the phone with my mom when I made it. (edit: so, distracted.)  Saying the famous last words ""that doesn't look like enough, I'll add more, it should be fine"" to myself......I proceeded to put 18x3/4c. (since that's a rice cooker cup) of medium-grain white rice.  It's no longer soup.  It's just delicious and curry-like.

&amp;#x200B;

I've experimented in Eat This Much by adjusting serving sizes (I tried splitting it up to 54), i.e.""thinning"" this mixture out with water/stock, and either chicken thighs or more canned chickpeas.  Many experiments later, it was still so...so carby.

May I please ask your suggestions on how to save this recipe (and my blood sugar)?  (not diabetic but that's my daily carb macro limit holy crap)

I don't eat red meat usually cause it makes me feel sick after. So mostly veg for the week, or the bit of tuna. Something a student could easily make. I'm cooking veg pasta tonight which will be my lunch and dinner tomorrow if I do the portions right.

Also how does one get over the temptation to eat something or drink something unhealthy.
