Our braised chicken drumsticks with parmesan rice is a wonderful mid-week dinner option when you don’t feel like fussing over a lot of ingredients.

Best of all, it’s extremely versatile. You can swap out the vegetables as you like. We used zucchini, but you can use mushrooms or fresh green beans or cauliflower florets.

# Ingredients for Braised Chicken Drumsticks with Parmesan Rice

**Braised Chicken Drumsticks:**

8 drumsticks

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

2 cubanelle peppers or 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, deseeded, and diced

2 medium zucchini, trimmed and diced

1 teaspoon each: dry thyme, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder, plus more to taste

1 14.5-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes

1/2 cup vegetable stock

Salt and pepper to taste

**Parmesan Rice:**

2 cups dry wild or brown rice

3 and 1/2 cups water

1 tablespoon butter, optional

Salt, to taste

1/2 cup freshly chopped parsley, plus more for serving

1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

# Method

**Prepare the Rice:**

In a saucepan, combine the rice with the water, butter, and salt, and cook according to package instructions. If using wild rice, this will typically be bringing it to a boil, stirring, covering, and simmering for about 45 minutes. Allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes before fluffing. Keep warm.

**Brown the Chicken:**

As the rice cooks, prepare the chicken. Preheat oven to 425ºF.

Heat the neutral cooking oil in a wide braising pot over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Brown the chicken, in batches if needed, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

**Brown the Vegetables:**

If the pot seems too dry, add another drizzle of oil and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion and cubanelle pepper and cook for 5 minutes until beginning to soften.

Add the zucchini and season all over with thyme, crushed red pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook without moving for 3 minutes or until the zucchini begins to turn dark brown in places.

**Braise the Drumsticks:**

Pour in the vegetable stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Pour in the diced tomatoes and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences (more salt, pepper, thyme, crushed red pepper, or garlic powder to taste).

Nestle the drumsticks into the braising pot and transfer to the oven for 25-35 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reaches 165ºF. If desired, broil the chicken for 1-2 minutes to allow the skin to darken in color even more.

**Prepare the Parmesan Rice:**

Right before serving, stir the parmesan and parsley into the rice and toss to combine. Season to your preferences.

**To Serve:**

Divide the rice between bowls and spoon the broth and vegetables from the braising pan over top. Place two chicken drumsticks on top of each dish. Garnish with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

I don't have a disposal or dishwasher, so clean up takes a lot longer. I try to generate as few dishes as possible. I may be able to get a countertop dishwasher in the future.

I'm generally not a fan of meal-prepping as there's only me to get through whatever I cook, and eating the same thing all week makes eating a chore instead of a delight.

Because I don't like making lots of dishes or eating the same thing over and over, I'm spending way too much on lunch out at work and convenience food at home. I need to turn that around.

I eat pretty healthy and enjoy lots of vegetables, fruit, and protein. I try to avoid too much starch as it's empty calories and can sits heavy on my stomach. The problem with produce and meat is that it's expensive. I'm not a big guy but eat fairly ample portions.

The grocery stores around me are quite expensive, too, although there's a Trader Joe's a mile away and a Costco about 20-30 minutes away. Cooking for one meal with one set of leftovers costs a lot and generates quite a bit of waste.

Does anyone have strategies or tactics to address the above (breaking out of the meal-planning doldrums and getting your veggies in)? ""Healthy"" means a lot of different things to different people, so I thought I'd be more specific here. Cheap and fast are also of the essence.

I used to cook a lot and was fairly good at it, but I've fallen out of practice. I do have a couple of kitchen appliances that may help, like an immersion circulator and an Instant Pot.

I come to you all seeing r/eatcheapandheathly. Was told I had this in the wrong place. Please help. I’m new to cooking and being a wife. My partner and I have been very sick lately and I know we aren’t eating as balanced as we could be. We are both trying to be healthier but still end up buying just go to fillers that do nothing to help. Our diet consists of mostly frozen proteins (e.g. fish sticks, breaded shrimp, nuggets), rice, peppered with the occasional fruits and rotisserie chicken. If you lovely people could help me get us in order I would be eternally grateful. Please save me. 

Like I said I’m very new to cooking and I’m not great at meal planning. I feel if I could meal prep that would help but I don’t know what to cook that is filling and nutritious. I’m only really allergic to avocado. My partner leans more to being  pescatarian and low carb while I welcome all meats but would also like to be low carb. We are picky but hit me with anything I’m open.  We are in the USA and we spend about $50-$60 a week. If we could spend less that would help other areas but for now nutrition is most important.

1 pack flour tortillas (10)— $1.79

10 eggs— $3

1 pack bacon—$5

Scramble the eggs, allow to cool.

Fry the bacon, set aside.

Brown the hashbrowns (can do this in a pan with the bacon grease or in the oven).

Make burritos. My preferred order of assembly is to place 1.3 bacon strips on the tortilla, some eggs on top, then the hot sauce, then the hashbrowns to hold it together. Then I roll it up right.

You can add cheese and other stuff to the scrambled eggs, it just raises the price a bit. I’ve added cheese, spinach, mushrooms, all worked great.

So, first off, love this sub when it shows up in my front page. I've gotten some good recipes from here in the past, including what's in my current meal list (which is very sparse). Anyway, though. I've got some pretty big major life issues going on right now that I don't need to get in to, but it is impacting my eating. Mostly it's hitting my drive to eat enough. I'm 30, male, and am sitting at 158lb last time I weighed myself like two days ago. About 2.5 weeks ago, I was 164-166 depending. There's a lot of stress, and I took up casual smoking, so that's not helping, but when I look at my eating I know I'm not getting anywhere near enough in my diet. So I'm looking for some help if possible.

As it is right now, my breakfast is pretty much always the same thing. I have two eggs in a frame (eggs basically sunny side up inside of bread that has a hole cut out of the inside for the egg to cook in) with some salt and pepper on them, and then three strips of bacon. I sometimes will add peanut butter on top of the eggs in a frame. Then my other meal, because I almost always only eat twice in the day, will consist of a burger (with some mustards, sometimes cheese. No bread) I've made myself ahead of time with a helping of steamed broccoli or cauliflower, or this fantastic meal I found on here which is chipotle black beans and cilantro lime rice that I'll put chicken in to. After I finish my current frozen stock of beef, I'll be mostly just having the bean, rice, and chicken dish. There will be days where, if I don't have work, I'll maybe eat a PB&amp;J at some point. Sometimes at work I'll have a trail bar of some sort, or some cashews. But that's about it

I know I need more of a lot of stuff. I need more calories in general, because I'm not getting anywhere near my TDEE. I know I need more veggies in my diet. I'm sure I need more of other stuff, too. One thing I'm solid with is getting enough water, so at least there's that. My issues is that I'm finding it hard to want to do more with my food. I do really enjoy the meals I'm having, despite it being the same thing all the time. Ideally, I would like things I could add to these meals that would help me out. I don't have a desk job, so eating at work is a little tough unless I'm on my break, which is when I'll eat my second meal. There is a fridge that I am able to store my food in, but I can't really duck back there to eat whenever, so anything I bring to work needs to be small and non perishable.

So I'm not necessarily looking for full on new recipes, but maybe just some suggestions for my current (super small) meal plan? I won't shy away from suggestions for other meals, but things that are simple are appreciated. I have a decently stocked kitchen (pressure cooker, instant pot, tabletop t-fal grill) in terms of cooking gear, but the simpler the better. I know one of the easiest ways to get more calories is going to be to eat more during the day, so even if it's suggestions of what to do for that, I'm all for it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Very fast and loose because I just kind of throw these things together. Don't have a price breakdown, but typically these are the meals that seem to last the longest for me, so I think they're not too bad cost-wise. These are cheap and easy from the perspective of a single person, by the way--I'm not sure if these might be more annoying to make with multiple people in mind.

1. Pork cutlets with mushroom and spinach creamy topping

This one just needs some pork cutlets (really cheap and on sale a lot for me), canned white mushrooms, spinach, chicken stock, and a teensy bit of flour (if you put too much it'll be REALLY thick which is still good but, up to you).

Season pork cutlets with salt and pepper (or whatever, honestly), put it on a plate. Then cook the canned mushrooms and spinach together in the juices, with garlic if you have it and garlic powder if you don't. Once they look mostly cooked, toss in the chicken stock and the flour and mix as well as you can until it reaches a good consistency.

I like to pair this with a baked potato for a really fancy feeling meal. Honestly, the texture of the mushrooms is great; hard to tell they're canned, at least like this. These heat up really well, so I usually make a huge batch and store the pork and topping separately. I want to say this one makes 4-5 servings for me.

2. Shrimp quesadillas

Prefacing this with I ALWAYS buy these guys on sale. It's like $10 for a lb and a half of shrimp, and I usually eat 4-5 shrimp for a serving. Lasts me about two weeks, maybe a little more! Good for some cheap luxury. This one's shrimp, canned rotel chile and tomato, canned refried beans, mexican cheese, and a tortilla.

Fry the shrimp with some onion and garlic powder, place the tortilla in the juices, slowly warm it up as you place the shrimp, beans, rotel mix, and cheese inside. Then crank it up to medium-high at the end for some crispiness.

I like to eat this one with sour cream. Works really well for reheating if you cook a bunch of shrimp in advance and just put the toppings in separate tupperware. I never have to actually cook the beans or tomatoes, so I usually just take them straight out of the can. I don't eat this one with vegetables as much because I'm awful and largely use it to get a good serving of protein for the day (like, I'll have a nice big salad for lunch), but you could probably just eat this with a salad or incorporate some bell peppers for cheap. With half a bag of mexican cheese and storing all the canned food at once, these can last quite a while, probably a week. However many tortillas and shrimp you have, honestly.

3. Tuna crab cakes

This is probably the most involved, but it makes for a really nice lunch! I use the flavored packets of tuna, but you could probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere. If you like the flavored ones, lemon pepper or sweet and spicy work best with this recipe. For this, you need a tuna packet, 1/2 cup or so of black beans (helps stretch the packets even further, but you can leave them out), an egg, mayonnaise, dijon mustard, lemon juice, sliced green onions, and panko bread crumbs.

Beat the egg, blend or mash the beans, then put everything in but the bread crumbs. Mix together and slowly mix in the bread crumbs until it seems to hold its shape. Shape them into patties, then throw them on medium-high heat, flipping over once the bottom gets crispy. These can be kind of messy, so just keep patting them back together.

I usually eat this one as a burger with a bun, but you could easily eat it on its own. I like to eat it with a salad or coleslaw (light on the dressing). One packet of tune and 1/2 of black beans makes about 3-4 servings for me (probably less if you don't have it with a bun), so this is the least prep-friendly, but it's pretty cheap and you can make it over and over again since mayo, eggs, and bread crumbs come in such big batches. These keep surprisingly well, too. I usually eat them cold  after the first time and lightly toast the bun. They make for a decent packed lunch.

4. Sausage and veg sheet pan

This is the ultimate easy recipe, though it takes the longest. I honestly can't bring myself to see how economical turkey sausage is since I love it so much, but I think the sausage is crucial for not having to worry about anything other than the veg getting perfectly cookd. This one is just sausage, cauliflower, broccoli, potato, and some parmesan cheese.

Place all of the ingredients evenly on aluminum foil within a sheet pan. Liberally dribble some olive oil and parmesan on top, with salt and pepper. Bake on 400 for 30-45 minutes, whenever the veg looks properly roasted.

For this one, I just bake the frozen vegetables straight from the freezer, which makes things super easy! I get these generic brand cauliflower and broccoli packets. I usually scarf this down within 4-5 sittings, using (almost) an entire thing of sausage and the whole bag of veg, plus like one potato.

Hope this is alright! Unfortunately I really don't have formal recipes, as I eyeball everything (which is what makes it ""easy"" for me). Hope you like!

EDIT: Some details that might be helpful. The shrimp are in shells, which helps with cost and makes them MUCH tastier, even though I don't cook them with the shells on (I hate peeling once they're cooked). Eating these kinds of meals + something like pasta, mushroom, ground beef, and brocc, I usually average out at $30/wk on food shopping at a not-inexpensive grocery store. Typically I just eat cereal for breakfast because I have very early mornings and need all the sleep I can get, but I doubt things would change much if you ate a proper breakfast.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figured I might share here to see if someone can get some use out of them!

I made this recently after realizing I had leftover chicken I needed to use up quickly. It's partly based on [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/df5ckg/comment/f314vmm), but I added some tweaks for more depth: I browned the butter and a little bit of chicken fat from the carcass, and threw in a small handful of cheddar and paprika for a sharper flavor. 

INGREDIENTS

3-4 cups shredded chicken
4-5 small carrots
1 cup each peas and corn
1/2 onion - or whole, if desired 
1/4 cup cream
1-2 cups broth, depending on how thin vs creamy you want it
1/2 cup sharp white cheddar
salt, pepper,garlic powder and paprika to taste
3-4 tablespoons butter
1 tbsp flour

DIRECTIONS

I used frozen peas and corn with fresh carrots, but frozen carrots should also be fine. I nuked the frozen stuff pretty quick while chopping up the carrots and onion.

Saute the onion for a minute, then add the carrot for a few more minutes before adding the rest of the veggies. You want to bring out the flavor of the veggies and make them less soggy.

Take veggies off heat. Add butter - and optionally add a pinch of chicken skin or fat. Cook butter on low heat until it turns brown.

Add flour, stir til you kinda have a roux. Add cream and broth, then stir in grated cheddar and stir quickly around until melted. 

Once it's all nice and blended, add chicken and veggies. Stir it all together. Top with paprika.

Optionally top with tin biscuits or crescent rolls, or go all out and stick in a pie crust and cook til the crust is done.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/kDazf7P""&gt;Photos here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Staple foods are things like maize, rice, potatoes, pasta, bread. Typically, i use rice, potatoes, or pasta. All types! Beans are counted in the ""protein"" section with poultry and meat but its nice to mix them in with some rice.

Veggies is self explanatory. I'd call green beans the ""universal side"" because i can't name a dish where they'd be a bad idea. I also like to use kale, broccoli stalk, lima beans, turnip, collard greens, and sweet peas. I guess if i buy peas and carrots i'd eat them, but i'm not a fan of those lol.

Finally meat. I typically eat mostly poultry like turkey and chicken and fish. Ever since i moved out, i rarely if ever buy pork chop or red meat in general. However, if i do, its either lamp chop or a simple pork chop. Other than that, you'll be good on chicken and fish really.

For the sake of simplicity, i almost *always* mix my veggies in with whatever the staple is. Rice n beans, pasta n kale, potatoes and broccoli, whatever.

As far as new recipes, i like to look up ""pasta"" version of recipes. Chicken Marsala with Ziti noodles, Curry Chicken Pasta with Fettuccine. Staples are fairly easy to replace...most of the time. Curry chicken works well with pasta or rice, as does marsala. I wouldn't however, try chicken marsala with potatoes as my base. 

If you wanna go full food pyramid mode, have a little side of fruit, yogurt, or a smoothie as a after dinner desert or snack.

For things like Pizza, Soup, and Stew, this doesn't *really* apply. However, for soup and stew, since everything is basically being cooked together, just have bread as a side.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staple+Veggies+Poultry/Meat/Beans/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

I also like to use kale, broccoli stalk, lima beans, turnip, collard greens, and sweet peas. I guess if i buy peas and carrots i&amp;#39;d eat them, but i&amp;#39;m not a fan of those lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally meat. I typically eat mostly poultry like turkey and chicken and fish. Ever since i moved out, i rarely if ever buy pork chop or red meat in general. However, if i do, its either lamp chop or a simple pork chop. Other than that, you&amp;#39;ll be good on chicken and fish really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, i almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; mix my veggies in with whatever the staple is. Rice n beans, pasta n kale, potatoes and broccoli, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as new recipes, i like to look up &amp;quot;pasta&amp;quot; version of recipes. Chicken Marsala with Ziti noodles, Curry Chicken Pasta with Fettuccine. Staples are fairly easy to replace...most of the time. Curry chicken works well with pasta or rice, as does marsala. I wouldn&amp;#39;t however, try chicken marsala with potatoes as my base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna go full food pyramid mode, have a little side of fruit, yogurt, or a smoothie as a after dinner desert or snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For things like Pizza, Soup, and Stew, this doesn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; apply. However, for soup and stew, since everything is basically being cooked together, just have bread as a side.&lt;/p&gt;

My partner and I are trying to be more health-conscious and eat less meat so this weekend we did a big meal prep to fill our freezer with lunches for the weeks ahead. We freeze portions individually then defrost the night before so that we can have a variety of meals in a week without getting bored. 


I cooked all of these in an afternoon as lots of the tasks are easy to juggle, highly recommend as now I don’t have to worry about work lunches for a couple weeks. These recipes are also easy to double without much extra effort if need be!


These ingredients made:

* 4 x carrot and ginger soup
* 8 x veggie lentil chili
* 4 x pasta sauce 
* 4 x mushroom stroganoff
* 4 x aubergine/eggplant and chickpea stew

I spent around £15 getting these ingredients but rounded up to £20 because of the cost of oil, spices and a couple cupboard staples.

Recipes:


**Carrot and ginger soup:**

* In large pot soften one onion, add minced ginger and garlic
* Stir until fragrant
* Peel and chop carrots (around 1 kg) into chunks
* Add to pot
* Add boiling water to cover with veggie stock (we use powdered Bouillon) 
* Simmer until carrots are soft
* Blend to desired consistency

Serve with dollop of sour cream

**Lenti chili**

There are a lot of good slow cooker chili options out there, personally I recommend the vegetarian lentil chili from Budget Bytes as it has black beans and kidney beans both which are super cheap, healthy and yummy.
Serve with choice of avocado/sour cream/ rice

**Pasta sauce:**

* Roasted 3 chopped red peppers with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian mixed herbs and olive oil
* Meanwhile soften 1 diced onion then add 3 crushed garlic cloves
* Chop 1 packet of mushrooms and add
* Add 2 tins of chopped tomatoes and roasted peppers

Serve with wholegrain pasta

**Mushroom stroganoff:**

I use the recipe from damn delicious with veggie stock instead of beef stock, but there are many variations on the recipe online depending if you prefer to use sour cream/cream cheese etc. 

**Aubergine and chickpea stew:**

* Chop 2 aubergines into cubes
* Add garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2tsp of cinnamon, mixed herbs, zaatar (optional but tastes great)
* Roast at 180 Celsius until soft
* In the meantime soften one chopped onion 
* Add minced garlic until fragrant
* Add 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* When hot and reduced in size add 1 can of chickpeas
* Season 
* Add aubergines when cooked
* Add more chopped tomatoes if you like it more liquid
* Add Tsp of vinegar to cut through tomato

Serve with rice, partner likes it with a big dollop of hummus on top.

Hope this is helpful!

Ingredients list:

* Mushrooms x 2 punnets
* Sour cream
* Chickpeas x tin
* Aubergines x 2
* Carrots x 2kg
* Ginger x1 inch
* Garlic x 1 head
* Black beans x 1 tin
* Brown lentils x1 bag
* Chopped toms x 5 tins
* Onions x 1kg
* Peppers x3
* Pasta x 0.5kg bag
* Rice x 0.5kg bag
* Avocado x 2
* Kidney beans x 1 tin

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aubergine and chickpea stew:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop 2 aubergines into cubes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2tsp of cinnamon, mixed herbs, zaatar (optional but tastes great)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roast at 180 Celsius until soft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the meantime soften one chopped onion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add minced garlic until fragrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 1 tin chopped tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hot and reduced in size add 1 can of chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add aubergines when cooked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more chopped tomatoes if you like it more liquid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Tsp of vinegar to cut through tomato&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve with rice, partner likes it with a big dollop of hummus on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mushrooms x 2 punnets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sour cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas x tin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aubergines x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrots x 2kg&lt;/li&gt;

Hubby: dairy and nut allergy
Toddler: dairy, nut and egg allergy
Baby (9m, breastfed and table food): milk and soy protien intollerance and egg allergy
Me: IBS with spelt/wheat, onion and lactose as my biggest triggers plus I cannot eat milk, soy or eggs due to breastfeeding


So as you can imagine, I not only have to get creative, but many traditional budget foods are off the list and we miss out on good deals. Sometimes I give things to my toddler but not to the baby, or the family will get wheat pasta whilst I get gluten free pasta (to avoid wheat, I am fine with gluten). But it takes a lot of juggling.


Eating cheap whilst ensuring we all eat healthy is a struggle. Like milk for instance. Hubby has soy milk which is cheap, but toddler wont touch it so gets fortified oat milk which is expensive, whilst baby and I get almond milk which is somewhere in the middle.


Toddler and hubby get cheap white bread, but it has soy flour so baby gets bakery bread which is more expensive but can be frozen. If I want the luxury of bread it has to be crazy expensive 30hr sourdough to be low fodmap and soy free so I often go without :(



I struggle with the most with breakfast and lunch. Dinner I have down but cookimg/preparing 3 meals a day, completely from scratch, whilst catering for everything is getting hard to do whilst providing a gpod variety of foods.

I’m a student living by myself for the first time and I’m trying really hard to eat well. When I think about the foods I eat I consider it quite healthy and balanced, however I’m worried that I mainly eat the same thing everyday. So I’m asking whether this is a bad thing? Based on my info below, do you considered my meals balanced? 

I am mainly asking this as I have had fatigue issues for the last 2 years and it hasn’t been getting better. I am also hungry very often and the doctor recommended that I put on some weight. Would love some suggestions on stopping fatigue with diet. 

This is what I typically eat;

Coffee with full cream milk (not creamer) and I one teaspoon of sugar with a 3 egg omelette with grated zucchini (courgette). I have this everyday and cannot function without breakfast. I don’t have a reliance on caffeine, and can do without if needed. 

For lunch usually a brown bread cheese and pesto sandwich with a piece of fruit and a glass of water. Or I have whole grain, rye crisp bread (not sure what it is in English, it’s a European thing) with peanut butter. I also have these as snacks and more fruit in summer. 


For dinner I always make stir fry, curry or pasta with the same ingredients. 
They are capsicum (red pepper), mushrooms, broccoli and zucchini (courgette) for every meal. I have this with either pork or chicken, sometimes beef mince for spaghetti. For pasta I make my own sauce, but for stir fry and curry I buy premade sauce. Sometimes I make white pasta and rice, sometimes brown. Mostly depends on my budget for the week. 

I make salads on days I’m not as hungry and more regularly in summer. My salads are basically again the same vegetables just with spinach and a dressing as well. 

I also have some chocolate maybe 3-4 times a week, and I probably have takeaway pizza or burgers maybe 2-3 times a month. 

Do you think I should try a greater variety of foods? With the whole 5 veg and fruit thing- I have 6 serving of which one is fruit. Is this okay?  
I don’t really like fruit haha

Bell peppers were on sale for $1 each and we bought 3. Blueberries were BOGO for $4 so we got two pints, a bunch of bananas, bulk-bin rolled oats, and a pound of grapes (also on sale) for about $10. Bratwursts were were BOGO so we got two packages (10 brats) for $4. We made a big pot of red beans and rice which we added bell pepper, onion, and brats to— about $4 for the rice and beans. 18 Eggs and a loaf of bread yielded several meals (omelets with onions and bell pepper, French toast with fruit, egg salad) for about $5. Two cans of chickpeas and some seasoning paired with rice yielded 4 Indian-food style meals for less than $4.

&lt;p&gt;I have done this will fajitas in the past, cut all peppers and onions, then cut the chicken and season it. Stays good for a few days waiting to be made. What are your favorite recipes that can be pre-prepped?&lt;/p&gt;

I know there has to be cheap, easy items that I can snack on, even as a diabetic. I enjoy lightly sweet, lightly salty, crunchy things. Not onions or bell peppers, or celery, but I do enjoy popcorn, ice (yes, I munch on ice when it's brittle enough), chips, crackers, etc. I don't like really sweet stuff, and really salty stuff turns me off of them really quick.

&lt;p&gt;I have a small mini fridge in my room and access to a microwave and a stove even though I have not used it once (shared kitchen bleh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cafeteria on campus is known for its sub-par food and I usually only ever get cereal or a bagel since I can make it myself. We also have a waffle making station which is alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know some cheap but healthy things I can buy to keep in my room/fridge or good healthy combinations I can make at the cafeteria? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help you can throw my way! :)&lt;/p&gt;

### INGREDIENTS

* 8 3/4""-thick slices crusty bread
* 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 2 15-oz. cans cannellini beans, rinsed
* 1 bunch kale or mustard greens, ribs removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces
* 1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

 

### RECIPE PREPARATION

* Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Brush bread on both sides with 4 Tbsp. oil total. Working in 2 batches, cook bread, pressing occasionally to help crisp, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Season toast with salt and pepper and set aside.
* Increase heat to medium-high and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in same skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
* Add beans and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to blister, about 3 minutes. Using a spoon, lightly mash about half of the beans. Add kale and broth and cook, tossing often, until kale is wilted, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.
* Serve beans and greens mixture over toast, drizzled with oil.

My week for dinner consists of:

One box of packaged leafy greens (or fresh)

Whichever protein source is on sale (chicken, beef, etc)

....and thats it.

In CAD, my total for the week comes up to $12 before tax (ex. one box of arugula, chicken breasts).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by setting my plate with the greens, and cook my protein source on the side (very simple: salt, pepper, &amp; herbs).

Spice to taste, sauce on the side, plate &amp; enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

Combinations of the two that i've made are:

Baby Arugula Blend &amp; Rib Eye Steak (Cooked Medium)

Spring Mix &amp; Chicken Strips (Topped w/ Alfredo Sauce)

Sauteed Green Beans &amp; Spring Mix, Tossed w/ Chicken Breast Chunks

Kale Blend &amp; Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin

Meat and Arugula Bowl (Literally Arugula and Chicken, tossed with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce)

&amp;#x200B;

This simple shopping list makes trips to the grocery, so so easy!

Cooking your own meat can be daunting at first, but make the pan your best friend! A little bit of oil &amp; butter goes a loooong way.

Experiment on what you're feeling, overcomplicating recipes/things can be such a hassle and take up so much time and energy.

**SAUSAGE QUINOA VEGGIE MEDLEY**

&amp;#x200B;

Around 580 Calories - - Make 4-6 servings -- About 30 minutes of prep/cooking

&amp;#x200B;

\- 1 lb ground Italian sausage (pork or chicken)

\- 1.5 cups uncooked quinoa

\- 1 chicken/beef/veggie bouillon cube

\- 3-5 stalks celery, diced

\- 3-5 carrots, diced

\- one red onion, diced

\- 3 cloves garlic, crushed

\- 1 cup sunflower seeds or sliced almonds

\- salt, pepper, or any seasoning you prefer

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cook quinoa according to instructions. Usually a 1:2 ratio of water. Add a bouillon cube to the water to help with flavor. Boil for 20 minutes or til soft and fluffy. Salt and pepper to taste.
2. While quinoa cooks, chop up all veggies, and add them to a large saucepan with a little olive oil on med-high heat.  Cook 5-7 minutes tossing occasionally. In the last minute add sunflower seeds and combine with veggies. Set aside mixture in (VERY) large bowl.
3. In the same pan you cooked the veggies, add more olive oil and cook the ground sausage, around 7-10 minutes
4. Once sausage is cooked, add it and the quinoa to the large bowl of veggie mixture. Toss all ingredients together. Season to taste.

Boom, you're done. Eat warm or cold, wrap it in a tortilla and have a taco, add to noodles and make weird pasta salad. Seriously, this stuff is good on anything.

*Mexican Chorizo Spice Blend:*

\---&gt; *”toastables”* (toast for 3-4 minutes in 350F oven)

\- Ancho Chili Powder, 3 tbsp \*deseeded for less spicy

\- Cumin Seed, 2 tbsp

\- Black Peppercorns, 12 whole 

\- Coriander Seed, 2 tsp

\- Whole Cloves, 10 cloves

\- Bay Leaves, 3 medium leaves

\---&gt; *“Non-toastables”*

\- Ground Cinnamon ½ tsp

\- Mexican Oregano Dry, 1 tsp

\- Fresh Thyme, 1 tsp

\- Paprika (hot or sweet), 5 tbsp \*Use hot paprika for more of a kick

\- Cayenne, 1 tsp

\- Kosher Salt, ½ tsp and more to taste

&amp;#x200B;

\- Fresh Garlic, minced 2 cloves

\- Apple Cider Vinegar 3 tbsp

\- Garnish - ½ cup loosely packed chopped cilantro

**Chipotle Lime Crema:**

\- Creme Fraiche or Sour Cream, ¼ cup

\- Chipotle in Adobo, 1 tbsp 

\- Fresh Lime Juice, ½ small lime plus more to taste

\- Kosher Salt, ½ tsp plus more to taste

**Soft-Boiled Egg Tips:**

\- Bring water to boil, then GENTLY add in eggs. Cook for 6.5 minutes. Shock in ice water for 3-4 minutes.

\- “Fridge cold” eggs, aka eggs directly taken from the fridge, are fine. No need to bring to room temp.

\- I find eggs are easier to peel under running water or completely submerged. The water seeps in between the cracks of the eggs to help the shell come off the egg.

For breakfast I usually eat some oatmeal with some ground flaxseed mixed in.  
  
I eat a lot of re-fried beans with scrambled eggs on the side. Heat up some oil on low &amp; fry some ground cumin &amp; hot pepper flakes for like a min. Add beans &amp; mash. Add some of the bean cooking liquid to get your desired consistency.   
  
I make popcorn or eat sunflower seeds when I want a snack.  I add extra virgin olive oil on top of the popcorn &amp; mix. I also grind my salt in a coffee grinder until it is a powder &amp; sprinkle on top with an old spice jar. Sticks way better than the larger crystals.

Eggs I usually scramble but when I am in the mood I make [Chinese Steamed Eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QbeSQLvdlE). Great with whole grain of your choice like brown rice or quinoa.

Middle Eastern - warmed pita, hummus, babaganoush, oven-crisped falafel.

Ice Cream Social - Dairy and non-dairy ice creams with healthy and not-so-healthy toppings

Ballgame - Mini hot dogs (vegan and non), relish, mustard and ketchup, mini burgers (vegan and non)

Build-your-own Chex mix - Popcorn, Chex, chocolates, nuts, dried fruit

Design-your-own mug cake - vegan and non cake batter (made from scratch) with fresh berries, chocolate, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, whipped cream (dairy and non)

I like there to be a little bit of interactivity because the point of the drinks is for everyone to relax and socialize at the end of the week.

One of my pantry staples is a variety of raw nuts. These are initially pretty expensive but the last a long time and are versatile, which makes them a good investment for your pantry in the long run. Plus, nutritionally nuts are some of the greatest bang for your buck. A couple Brazil nuts contain enough Selinium to meet your requirements for the week. There are also [studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/well/eat/walnuts-for-weight-loss.amp.html) that suggest that adding nuts to your diet, while calorically dense, can help you lose weight. Because of the high calorie content and good fats, they keep you satiated for longer than a lot of other food choices you could make. Raw nuts are versatile for me because I also use them to make my own nut milk, which is [super easy](https://youtu.be/TQtRv-wdaJU) to make if you haven’t tried. All you need is a blender and either cheese cloth or a special nut milk bag. Nut milk is pretty expensive to buy premade imo. Although keep in mind that a homemade version has a much shorter shelf life (about 3-4 days in your fridge).    

On to snack mixes! Lightly roast nuts in the oven with salt (most nuts take about 8ish minutes at 400 degrees F). Keep it that simple and just add some dried fruit or other seeds (I also like cacao nibs) and call it a day. Or you can also season the nuts with basically anything you like. Some of my favorites are: rosemary and Parmesan, chili powder, curry powder, wasabi powder, and most recently this absolutely divine [savory and spicy rosemary recipe](https://www.nospoonnecessary.com/savory-spicy-rosemary-roasted-nuts/).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack mixes are really expensive to buy premade, but you can make your own for way less and it allows you to customize to your own tastes or experiment with flavors!    &lt;/p&gt;

Not only are legumes such as chickpeas delicious and nutritious, they are also dirt cheap, especially if you buy them dry.

This chickpea salad is packed with protein and fiber and very easy to make! All you have to do is mix everything together and enjoy. This big batch cost less than 5$ and yields 4 pretty generous 200g/7 oz portions. I just used a recipe from Frugal Nutrition (https://www.frugalnutrition.com/chickpea-tzatziki-salad/) with minor tweaks: tzatziki dip instead of greek yogurt, substituted cucumbers for radishes and added a small can of whole kernel corn and a small can of lemon pepper tuna. You can enjoy this healthy meal on its own, with lettuce or in a sandwich.

This lemon-dill chicken with cauliflower is a quick, healthy weeknight dinner option that is endlessly versatile. 

**Amendments:**

Replace the cauliflower with any anything from potatoes to zucchini or broccoli. You can serve over cooked rice or with mashed potatoes or cooked orzo. You can also add asparagus or sugar snap peas during the last few minutes of cooking for crisp, bright finish.

You can replace the chicken with chicken thighs, drumsticks, or with pork tenderloin or chops. Just amend the cooking time, as needed. You can also make this vegetarian or vegan with a can of chickpeas or cannellini beans instead of chicken.

## Grade:

Serves: 4

Cost: $4.25 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes (20 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients Lemon-Dill Chicken with Cauliflower

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

1 head of cauliflower, trimmed and cut into florets

1 pint cherry tomatoes

3 cups chicken stock

2 tablespoons butter, optional

3 sprigs of thyme (or 1 teaspoon dry thyme)

1 teaspoon paprika

1 teaspoon garlic powder

2 tablespoons freshly chopped fresh dill, plus more for serving

1 lemon, divided

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

Extra virgin olive oil

## Method

## Prepare the Chicken:

Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.

In a wide sauté pan, heat the neutral oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook without moving for 4-5 minutes until well-browned. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

## Cook the Onions:

If the pan seems dry, add another drizzle of oil. Once hot, add the onions to the pan and cook until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Stir the onions regularly to ensure they aren’t sticking.

## Sauté the Cauliflower:

Add the cauliflower florets to the pan and cook for 5 minutes or until they just begin to turn golden brown in spots. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute or two.

## Prepare the Broth:

Pour the chicken stock into the pan and scrape up any browned bits. Bring to a boil and season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Add the butter, if desired, and then reduce heat to low and add the thyme sprigs. Once the butter has melted, nestle the chicken into the broth.

## Cook the Chicken:

Cut the ends off the lemon and squeeze the juice from the ends over the chicken. Cut the middle of the lemon into four rounds and place a round on each chicken breast. Sprinkle the chopped dill on top.

Cover and simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken reaches 160ºF. If you prefer not to broil the chicken, simply cook until the chicken reaches 165ºF and proceed with serving and skip the next step.

## Broil the Chicken (Optional):

Turn the broiler on to high. Remove the lid from the pan and drizzle the chicken with extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 5 minutes or until the lemon rounds char and the tops of the chicken breasts turn golden brown and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165ºF. Remove from the broiler.

## To Serve:

Spoon the cauliflower and tomatoes into shallow bowls and spoon the broth over top. Serve the chicken on top and garnish with more fresh dill. Drizzle each dish with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if desired.

And it can be very budget friendly! Here is what I have been doing recently for make ahead lunches or quick dinners.

For one bowl, I will use a quarter of a frozen bag of corn($.25), half a can of black beans($0.50), half of a slice of tempeh($1) or other meat substitute, and half a cup of either brown rice($0.50) or quinoa($1).
Plus various spices. That is about $3.75 for a high protein fiesta bowl that tastes pretty good! Also that price can be brought down slightly of the ingredients are bought in bulk.

I usually fry the tempeh for 5 minutes each side over medium high heat until golden brown with a dash of soy sauce or just salt and pepper depending on whats on hand. While that is cooking I start the rice or quinoa, either a rice cooker or on the stove. After the tempeh is golden brown, I remove it from the pan turn the heat to low and add a little more oil. I toss in the frozen corn and let it grill for a few minutes on high heat, it is best when it turns golden brown and gets grill marks! Finally, I will add the can half a can of black beans without draining it and let it cook for about 5 minutes. I usually season it with a little bit of garlic powder, chili pepper, salt, and cayenne and dried cilantro. Optionally, you could get super fancy and serve it with some lime juice squeezed on top and a couple scoops of salsa!

This process ussually takes me about 20 minutes start to finish and only dirties two pans(one for the quinoa/rice and one for stir frying the other stuff) and one dish.

What you need: lettuce, avocado, can of tuna, lemon/lemon juice, salt and pepper. Grab some lettuce and cut up about 1.5-2 cups (or any  salad greens, but lettuce is the cheapest). Open the tuna and drain the water. I always purchased light tuna in water, but you might like oil more.  Once the water was discarded, I'd through the tuna in a pan and fry it, normally with no oil since it's already fatty, for a minute or so, just to warm it up and get it a bit crispy. I'd throw it over the lettuce, add salt and pepper, and then squeeze some lemon.  Finally, I'd add about 1/3-1/2 an avocado. Because of the fat in the tuna and avocado, it's savory enough to not require any dressing.  I'm lucky enough that we grow our own avocados, lemons, and tomatoes, which I sometimes add as well.  I know avocados aren't the cheapest, but often times you can find them for a dollar a piece.  And if you only use 1/3-1/2 at a time, I think it's a great addition to the salad. Lettuce is about $1-2 for 3 heads here. And to save money on lemons, you could just be lemon juice. Just thought I'd give this simple, quick meal that helped me lose weight a shout.

Long time lurker, but I wanted to share my favorite quick, cheap, and healthy meal!

I really like to buy one dollar (US) bags of frozen peas because they are so cheap for such a versatile veggie, then pour a portion of them into a bowl, add a splash of water, then cover and microwave for 2 minutes. They are supposed to cook in the bag, but I don't ever eat a whole bag at once so this works too.  

Then, I usually have left over rice because it is one of my favorite foods, so I add about half rice and half peas and microwave for another minute. Fresh from the rice maker works too, but I just mix and microwave the peas for one minute more on their own usually then add the fresh rice. 

Then, I cook 2 eggs in a pan with salt and pepper and add the rice and peas and mix once the eggs are fully cooked. In the pan, I turn off the heat and add soy sauce, chili sauce with garlic, black pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder.

(Long story.) I was considering a quiche, but every time I make one I end up throwing out the last piece or two. No one likes day-old quiche. 

I was thinking it would be smarter to do muffin cup quiche, so I can freeze part of it. 

Questions, though. Do I roll out the pie crust to the same thickness are I would for a regular pie? Is there a trick to getting the crust to the exact size for the muffin tins? Does it have to be circular or can I just cut the crust in squares, then trim off the edges? Does that waste too much? Do I need to oil the muffin cups before I put the crust in? 

Heeeeeeelp!


**Update**: This is way to late for anyone to see, but just in case anyone is curious...        

The quiche was delish. I did the tart things in a muffin tin. I did the pie crust, and blind baked for 5 minutes. I half filled with onion and mushroom. Then added a generous dollop of grated cheddar, and filled with the egg mixture. Baked for 40 minutes.  

They came out fabulous. They look way more professional that I have any right to expect. Half are in the freezer now, and I'm looking forward to having a quick breakfast available. 

I discovered a couple of things. The pie dough for one crust fills about 8 cups. I was thinking it would make 12 (a full tin) and had already made enough filling for 12. So 4 of them ended up being crustless quiche. Surprisingly, they came out fine. Didn't fall apart, but I like with the crust better. 

I think next time I will make the crust extremely thin and stretch it to 12 cups. This time I stuck with the same thickness as a regular pie crust, not really knowing how it would taste. Since the crustless came out fine, I think I will be okay with a very, very thin crust, knowing that I'm not depending strictly on the crust to hold them together. 

I tried making the crust in a number of ways. First tried the ball method. Didn't like it at all. I couldn't get the crust even. Then I tried the circle and strip method. Didn't like that either. I couldn't get enough leverage or space to seal the seams well enough. Then I simply cut squares of pie dough. Gathered up the corners of the square so that it draped to a point in the middle, and placed it into the cup. Pressed down into the bottom (see below) and trimmed the edges. 

You can't use your fingers to press or shape the crust in muffin tins if you have fingernails. *(sigh)* I tried a couple of things--spoon, knife, even my knuckles--and finally settled on the ball part of a small metal measuring spoon. It had just enough of a curve to get the dough flat into the bottom of the tins without putting holes in it. 

It took longer to cook than I thought. I was thinking about 20 minutes, but it took 40. I don't know if that's because there was a lot of cheese, or because the mushrooms have a lot of liquid, or what.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I have this extra pie crust dough in the fridge that I need to use today. (Long story.) I was considering a quiche, but every time I make one I end up throwing out the last piece or two. No one likes day-old quiche. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking it would be smarter to do muffin cup quiche, so I can freeze part of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions, though. Do I roll out the pie crust to the same thickness are I would for a regular pie? Is there a trick to getting the crust to the exact size for the muffin tins? Does it have to be circular or can I just cut the crust in squares, then trim off the edges? Does that waste too much? Do I need to oil the muffin cups before I put the crust in? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heeeeeeelp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This is way to late for anyone to see, but just in case anyone is curious...        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quiche was delish. I did the tart things in a muffin tin. I did the pie crust, and blind baked for 5 minutes. I half filled with onion and mushroom. Then added a generous dollop of grated cheddar, and filled with the egg mixture. Baked for 40 minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They came out fabulous. They look way more professional that I have any right to expect. Half are in the freezer now, and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to having a quick breakfast available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered a couple of things. The pie dough for one crust fills about 8 cups. I was thinking it would make 12 (a full tin) and had already made enough filling for 12. So 4 of them ended up being crustless quiche. Surprisingly, they came out fine. Didn&amp;#39;t fall apart, but I like with the crust better. &lt;/p&gt;

- drained 14oz can of diced tomatoes  
- 1c chicken broth (can use veggie broth to make it vegan)

- 1/4c tahini

Simmer all but tahini and butter for 20 minutes. Add tahini then use immersion blender, or remove half and place in regular blender, to partially blend. Once to desired texture mix in butter. Can be enjoyed on its own or placed on grain of choice for a cheap easy dinner.

This harissa spiced vegetable soup is an amazing dinner – a harissa vegetable soup filled to the brim with fresh and frozen vegetables and loads of spices.

This recipe is incredibly versatile. We used a combination of fresh and frozen vegetables, like frozen corn and fava beans and fresh carrots and green beans. The base of this harissa vegetable soup is plenty of aromatics and a few heaping tablespoons of spicy harissa.

You can add a can of chickpeas instead of potatoes and I think finely chopped fresh zucchini would be a nice way to garnish it and complement the heat from the harissa! A splash of lemon juice at the end would also be welcome :)

Recipe here originally: [Harissa Spiced Vegetable Soup](https://triedtrue.us/HarissaVegetableSoup)

## Grade:

Serves: 8

Cost: $2.01 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 1 hour (40 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients Harissa Spiced Vegetable Soup

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and minced

4 stalks celery, small-diced

4 medium carrots, peeled and diced

5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

3 heaping tablespoons harissa paste

4 cups vegetable stock, plus more as necessary

1 28-ounce can diced or crushed tomatoes

4 Yukon gold potatoes, medium-diced

1 cup frozen corn

1 cup frozen fava beans

10 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed and halved

1 tablespoon paprika

1 teaspoon dry parsley

1 teaspoon dry thyme

Salt and pepper to taste

**For Serving:**

Freshly minced parsley

Extra virgin olive oil

Dry harissa powder, optional

## Method

## Cook the Aromatics:

In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-12 minutes or until the onion and celery begin to turn golden brown and soften.

Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant. Season the aromatics with salt and pepper.

## Prepare the Harissa Base:

Add the harissa to the pot and coat the vegetables in the paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the harissa begins to deepen in color.

Pour in the vegetable stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.

## Assemble the Harissa Vegetable Soup:

After the vegetable stock, add the canned tomatoes along with the potatoes. Season with the dry spices – paprika, parsley, and thyme – and with an additional shake of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are just barely fork-tender.

## Finish the Soup:

If the soup seems too thick, add a bit more stock. Next, add the frozen vegetables along with the fresh green beans and simmer an additional 15-20 minutes or until all the vegetables are cooked through. Taste and season to your preferences.

## To Serve:

Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley and a sprinkle of dry harissa. Add a drizzle or two of extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIC:  &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/YkzDIht.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/YkzDIht.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

1 large butternut squash   
1 tin of chopped tomatoes  
2 cloves of garlic  
1 egg  
breadcrumbs  
salt, pepper, chili powder or equivalent  
olive oil or butter  
optional grated cheese/parmesan

Heat olive oil in a saucepan, add thinly sliced or minced garlic, then after a few seconds pour in the tinned tomatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste, plus about half a teaspoon of chili flakes/chili powder. You can also add a pinch of sugar and some herbs (for example basil or oregano). Let it simmer.

Peel and gut the butternut squash, then slice into about 1.5 cm thick half moons. Dip each piece in seasoned egg then breadcrumbs, and fry in butter or olive oil until golden either side. Lay out the squash in your roasting tin, then cover evenly with the sauce. Sprinkle some grated parmesan or other cheese on top if you want. Roast for 30min at 180°C (356°F).

I've blended the granola and yogurt with mango for smoothies.

I've made pasta with the bacon fat and cooked rice with bacon fat and topped both with the bacon.

I eat bean and avocado quesadillas for breakfast every morning.

Maybe sandwiches with the bread?

I'll be making this for the night before Thanksgiving, which is coming soon for us here in the cold North. I'm sorry I don't have a photo right now but I wanted to share.

#Ingredients 

1 teaspoon olive oil

1# Premio Italian sausage, casing removed and meat cut into small pieces 1,709

1# bag fresh spinach, cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces 80

1# fresh crimini mushrooms, cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces 99

28 oz. can diced tomatoes 105

14 oz. can beans (kidney, etc.) 1,322

1 quart Swanson chicken stock 63

2 quarts water 

**Spices to taste** -- Garlic, Rosemary, lemon zest, fennel seed, chili peppers, whatever you like, it will be good with this! I recommend throwing in a Parmesan rind if you have one for richness without calories.

*The number after each ingredient above is its total calorie count, not its count per serving.*

#Instructions 

Heat the oil in the bottom of a Dutch oven over medium. Add the sausage and cook until just done, then pour off the fluids into a fat separator or a cup to reclaim any juices later. Add the mushrooms and spinach. Stir until the spinach begins to wilt, cover and reduce to low. 

Remove the cover in 5 minutes and stir, adding desired spices, salt and pepper to taste. Stir until the mushrooms stop releasing moisture, the spinach is completely wilted and the spices are fragrant, then add the remaining ingredients. Correct spices. 

Raise the heat to medium-high and stir frequently until the soup begins to boil, then reduce to simmer for 10 minutes, covered. Add back juices after skimming off fat, if desired.

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently found out Groupon is doing a deal right now on Costco memberships that ends today. It looks like it's a normal membership but you get some coupons and stuff. Cool. I haven't had a bulk warehouse membership in about 7 years, which I didn't use a lot because it was far away so I cancelled it. I've been reconsidering it recently.  Is it worth it to get a membership to the Costco? When I had a membership last ( at a Sam's club) the normal stuff I would love to buy in bulk was actually more expensive or equal. Have things changed? Would it be worth it? I know the rotisserie chicken is good but is it GOOD ENOUGH? I do the bulk of my shopping at a local Asian grocery store chain (not H Mart) and get the rest at Kroger (since a lot of western items are more expensive at the Asian store, ie. toilet paper, paper towels, etc). I looked and there's a Costco right down the street from the place I usually go. I'm trying very much to eat less processed stuff so bulk snacks are pretty much out of the window, and I don't know if the produce will rival the Asian market. I'm torn.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I recently found out Groupon is doing a deal right now on Costco memberships that ends today. It looks like it&amp;#39;s a normal membership but you get some coupons and stuff. Cool. I haven&amp;#39;t had a bulk warehouse membership in about 7 years, which I didn&amp;#39;t use a lot because it was far away so I cancelled it. I&amp;#39;ve been reconsidering it recently.  Is it worth it to get a membership to the Costco? When I had a membership last ( at a Sam&amp;#39;s club) the normal stuff I would love to buy in bulk was actually more expensive or equal. Have things changed? Would it be worth it? I know the rotisserie chicken is good but is it GOOD ENOUGH? I do the bulk of my shopping at a local Asian grocery store chain (not H Mart) and get the rest at Kroger (since a lot of western items are more expensive at the Asian store, ie. toilet paper, paper towels, etc). I looked and there&amp;#39;s a Costco right down the street from the place I usually go. I&amp;#39;m trying very much to eat less processed stuff so bulk snacks are pretty much out of the window, and I don&amp;#39;t know if the produce will rival the Asian market. I&amp;#39;m torn. I&amp;#39;ll be sure to visit my local Costco when I can but I wanted some others&amp;#39; input.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's my mujadara recipe:

In a covered sauté pan over medium heat, cook the onions in the oil and 1 tsp of salt until really browned, for about 30-40 min.  Meanwhile, prep your rice and lentils.  Soak the rice in water to cover.  Also, check the lentils for debris, then boil for 12 minutes in 2 cups of water.  Now drain the lentils and the rice.  Once the onions are really caramelized but not burned, add soaked rice, par-boiled lentils, 1 tsp salt, and 2 cups of water to the sauté pan with the onions.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 20-25 minutes at a medium-low boil until the liquid is absorbed and the rice and lentils are cooked through. Stir occasionally while simmering.

**Slow Cooker Butter Chickpeas**

 INGREDIENTS

1 package firm tofu (12 oz.)

1 tablespoon olive oil or vegan butter

1 medium size onion, diced

4 garlic cloves, minced

1 can coconut milk (I used light)

1 cup tomato puree

1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon garam masala

1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon curry powder

2 teaspoons chili powder

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

salt/pepper

1 15 oz can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained

1/8 cup cilantro, finely chopped

INSTRUCTIONS

Remove the tofu from the package and rinse. Wrap tofu in a paper towel and place on a cutting board. Placing something heavy on top of the tofu to allow the water to drain out, about 15 minutes.

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onion. Cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add in the garlic and stir to combine.

Whisk in the coconut milk, tomato puree, garam masala, curry powder, chili powder, ground ginger and a pinch salt/pepper.

Cook until slightly thick, about 5 minutes.

While the sauce is cooking, finely cube the tofu.

Place the tofu and garbanzo beans in the base of slow cooker. Pour the sauce on top. Cook on low for 5 hours until thick. You can cook the sauce longer if needed.

Before serving, stir in the cilantro.

Serve with rice and naan.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently preparing &lt;a href=""https://www.delishknowledge.com/slow-cooker-butter-chickpeas/""&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; for tomorrow.

So as a fitness-minded vegetarian who loves to cook for my fiance and I, he and I spend a lot of our time looking for recipes, logging things on MyFitnessPal, agonising about protein content per recipe, etc. It's real boring, but we do what we do for good eats and #gainz!

Consequently I've been keeping a record of all the recipes we've made and the calories, carbs, protein and fats per serving, so I know what's especially delicious or nutritionally dense (to make again) or what we personally found disappointing or low in macros (to avoid). Most of the food is also pretty budget-friendly (especially the various Mealime recipes) because we are not rich!

I've put it all in this Google Sheet right here:

Shout-outs also to VegFAQs.com who maintain [their own list of high-protein vegetarian recipes by % protein per calorie](https://vegfaqs.com/high-protein-vegan-recipes/), and from whom I shamelessly stole that idea for my own spreadsheet.

Hey guys! 

I am in my mid twenties, 6ft4, train in the gym 5 days a week, and I weigh 82kg. 

I am currently doing a bulk, so I have just started having 12 inch subways whilst I am on my lunch break at work. 

It allows me to consume around 1000 calories in one subway meal. This makes it a lot easier for me to reach my goal of having 500 calories over my caloric maintenance level. It’s also very easy on the wallet and in practical terms it’s next door to my office. 

I usually have 12inch subways, that include either chicken and bacon, meatball Mariana, or salami and pepperoni. 

I have this with the salad they offer, aswell as southwest sauce, mayo or bbq. 

I plan on doing this for around 9 months ( my bulking phase ). I was just wondering is this very unhealthy and will there be any long term negative effects ?

Let's see how far we can go!

As a rule for myself, I will be doing vegetarian versus vegan version. In order to avoid restricting myself to too few choices, egg and dairy products are allowed. (I think I cannot last very long if those are not even allowed. I know it's not ideal but just try to be realistic)

Some fresh fruit is cheaper to buy than some frozen fruit, but a couple that are better priced than fresh are raspberries and blueberries! They usually run at $4-$5 a pint in Ontario with the exception of raspberries being about a dollar cheaper in the spring time, but the frozen ones stay at $3.99 a bag on average, which is 600g (a pint is under 500g).

Some fresh fruit is cheaper to buy than some frozen fruit, but a couple that are better priced than fresh are raspberries and blueberries! They usually run at $4-$5 a pint in Ontario with the exception of raspberries being about a dollar cheaper in the spring time, but the frozen ones stay at $3.99 a bag on average, which is 600g (a pint is under 500g).

# Plov

Well seasoned rice dish with your choice of meat. My recipe is very different from traditional Uzbek dish, but uses less spices and I tried it with chicken, beef, and lamb

## Ingredients

* 1lb meat, cut into bite sized chunks
* If chicken, 2 tsp oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 carrots, shredded
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 cup rice
* 1 garlic blub

## directions

Cut meat into bite sized chunks. In a pot, start sauteing the meat. If it's chicken, as some oil first. While cooking meat, chop an onion. Once meat is cooked on all sides if it's beef, drain fat. Add onion, salt and pepper. Shred carrots, stirring meat and onion occasionally. Add carrots. Cook for about 5 minutes or until carrot slices look soft. 

At this point there will be some juice in the pot. Add little bit less than 2 cups water - enough to make 2 cups with the juice. Add rice. Bring to simmer and leave it until rice is cooked. Peal garlic bulb. Once the rice is cooked, thumb garlic cloves into rice, spread evenly, take off the heat. There should be no liquids left in the pot. If rice is cooked but there are still liquids - you added too much water. Don't add as much next time. But dish is still yummy with some water. Just soggy. Let sit for 10 minutes, mix, ready to serve.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some trouble finding new recipes of dinners that leave good leftovers and are healthy.

With this being a recipe from my grandmother, measurements are weird, and sometimes this soup just takes some practice. (Edit - the measurements given will make a full pot of soup, this is not intended as a single serving!)

Dump some dry oats into a pan, with just enough butter to keep them from sticking to the pan (3/4 to 1 cup of oats is a good place to start, and I usually start with a 1/2 stick of butter - it will still look dry, but the butter helps the oats cook evenly). Stir constantly on medium/high heat until all of the oats are *almost* burnt, like the color of walnuts. It's always better for them to be a bit too burnt than to be undercooked in this soup, so if you're not sure, keep going! 

Once the oats are *almost* burnt, add just a little bit of water, like 1/2 cup. Also, stand back when you do this, because it will steam like crazy. Turn down the heat to a simmer and let the water absorb a bit. Continue to add water like this, 1/2 to 1 cup at a time and letting it absorb for a few minutes until it looks like quicksand (I usually plan to add around 4 cups, but it's often more). Thinner is better, because the next step will thicken up the soup a bit.

In a separate container, whisk up 2-3 eggs. While you stir the soup, slowly drizzle in the eggs, making long white ""wispies"". 

Turn off the heat, add salt and pepper, and enjoy!

\-stirred it into peanut butter to make a dip for my celery sticks

\-used a bit of it when making scrambled eggs / omelettes as a replacement for crème fraîche (gordon ramsay's preferred way of making eggs. it makes them especially nice and velvety!)

\- made a delicious overnight marinade for chicken thighs. combined with lemon juice and chopped herbs (a splurge, unless you happen to have a friend with an herb garden on their balcony or are a member of your neighborhood's community garden!).

\- substituted it for mayonnaise on sandwiches as well as when making chicken salad (which was a way i changed up leftover chicken that had been marinated in yogurt earlier in the week)

\-ate it like normal, sweetened with a little bit of preserves and honey.

1-2 tsp celery salt (or regular, to taste)

1 tsp cumin

1 tsp onion powder

1 tsp garlic powder

1 tsp thyme

1 can corn

1 can black beans

1 large can diced tomatoes

1 quart chicken or vegetable stock

2 tbsp olive oil (or your preference) 

Sour cream (optional)

Avocado (optional)

Tortilla chips (optional)

1. Set slow cooker to high
2. Put oil into slow cooker and add chicken along with spices apple cider vinegar, onion, jalapeno and enough broth to almost submerge the chicken
3. Cook on high for about 3-4 hours or until you can shred the chicken. To shred chicken just grab two forks and pull the meat apart.
4. Once chicken is fully cooked and shredded, add in the remainder of the ingredients and broth. Add in all the juices from your cans.
5. Cook for an additional 3-4 hours (or transfer to stove top for quicker meal completion.
6. Taste and add more seasoning as required, I like extra apple cider vinegar for more tang.
7. When served in a bowl, add the optional sliced avocado, a dollop of sour cream or a handful of crunched up chips for a little extra.

This is my first recipe and I don't ever measure my ingredients so please tinker with the amounts. I also was using frozen chicken thighs so your could cook much quicker already defrosted.

I don't have any pictures because I ate it so fast.

**Ingredients:**    

- Bun  
- 1/2 grilled chicken breast  
- Slice of mozzarella (probably optional, I'm still experimenting with this. I don't really)  
- Slice of pineapple  
- Barbecue sauce (I love Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet 'n Spicy)  
- 1/2 tbsp butter  
- 4 cloves garlic (optional, I guess, but it puts the ""fckn"" in ""fckn delicious"")  

**Recipe:**  

0. If you haven't already grilled or pan-fried your chicken, do that and slice it.  
1. Peel your garlic and smash em  
2. Melt that butter in a pan and throw the garlic in. Let that get nice and smelly  
3. Cut the bun in half and toast it in the pan on top of the garlic  
4. While buns are toasting, slice off a piece of mozz  
5. While buns are toasting, slice a few pieces of thin pineapple  
6. After desired toasting has been achieved, pull the buns out. The garlic should be stuck to them  
7. Stack bun, chicken, mozz, and pineapple. Drizzle with barbecue sauce and put on top bun  

**Cost breakdown:** 
 
Ingredient | Cost per sandwich | Notes
:--|:--|:--
Bun | $0.25 | Kroger sells 8 bakery buns for $1.99
Chicken | $0.50 | At $1.99/lb, I get four-five massive GMO breasts for $8-9. I butterfly them to pan fry, and then I use about 1/2 of 1/2 of one. That comes out to about a 1/4 lb chicken, or $0.50.
Mozzarella | $0.34 | $5.49 for Kroger's 16 oz mozzarella. I cut it into about 16 slices and use one slice.
Pineapple | $0.06 | $0.88 per medium pineapple, I cut it into four wedges and core them, then I take three thin slices from one wedge. I could get about 12 slices per wedge, so 3/48 * 0.88 = 0.055. I usually can't stop myself from eating the rest of the pineapple in one sitting they're so good.
Barbecue sauce | $0.10 | $2.49 for an 18 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's, I use about 1.5 tbsp. $2.49 / (18oz * 2 tbsp/oz) * 1.5 tbsp = 0.1
Garlic | $0.20 | Kroger sells $0.69 garlic bulbs (nice), 4 cloves is probably 1/3 of one.
Butter | $0.05 | $3.29 for four sticks = 32 tbsp or 64 1/2tbsp. 3.29 / 64 = 0.05
**Total:** |  $1.50 | For a very filling sandwich. If you leave out mozzarella it's even cheaper. Increase butter to 1 tbsp for flavor or decrease for health.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kroger near me is selling pineapples for $0.88 each, so I thought I&amp;#39;d take advantage and make some fckn delicious sandwiches on the cheap.

&lt;li&gt;Slice of mozzarella (probably optional, I&amp;#39;m still experimenting with this. I don&amp;#39;t really)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slice of pineapple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barbecue sauce (I love Sweet Baby Ray&amp;#39;s Sweet &amp;#39;n Spicy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 tbsp butter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 cloves garlic (optional, I guess, but it puts the &amp;quot;fckn&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;fckn delicious&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already grilled or pan-fried your chicken, do that and slice it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peel your garlic and smash em&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt that butter in a pan and throw the garlic in. Let that get nice and smelly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut the bun in half and toast it in the pan on top of the garlic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While buns are toasting, slice off a piece of mozz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While buns are toasting, slice a few pieces of thin pineapple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After desired toasting has been achieved, pull the buns out. The garlic should be stuck to them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack bun, chicken, mozz, and pineapple. Drizzle with barbecue sauce and put on top bun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Ingredient&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Cost per sandwich&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bun&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Kroger sells 8 bakery buns for $1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Chicken&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;At $1.99/lb, I get four-five massive GMO breasts for $8-9. I butterfly them to pan fry, and then I use about 1/2 of 1/2 of one. That comes out to about a 1/4 lb chicken, or $0.50.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Mozzarella&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$5.49 for Kroger&amp;#39;s 16 oz mozzarella. I cut it into about 16 slices and use one slice.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Pineapple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.06&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.88 per medium pineapple, I cut it into four wedges and core them, then I take three thin slices from one wedge. I could get about 12 slices per wedge, so 3/48 * 0.88 = 0.055. I usually can&amp;#39;t stop myself from eating the rest of the pineapple in one sitting they&amp;#39;re so good.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Barbecue sauce&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$2.49 for an 18 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray&amp;#39;s, I use about 1.5 tbsp. $2.49 / (18oz * 2 tbsp/oz) * 1.5 tbsp = 0.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Garlic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Kroger sells $0.69 garlic bulbs (nice), 4 cloves is probably 1/3 of one.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Butter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$3.29 for four sticks = 32 tbsp or 64 1/2tbsp. 3.29 / 64 = 0.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;For a very filling sandwich. If you leave out mozzarella it&amp;#39;s even cheaper. Increase butter to 1 tbsp for flavor or decrease for health.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

I've been on this subreddit for a while and I appreciate all the posts here. 

Here is my issue : I eat very unhealthy and order food online too often for my taste. It costs money and, at the end of the day, I eat crap. 

Is it possible to cover all the nutrients you need in only two different meals ? I don't like cooking so it's a bother to have to cook different meals. I don't mind eating the same meals every day. On the contrary, I like it. 

For example, I've heard that you can live on potatoes alone (almost). 
Can you help me ? 
I live in France, if that helps.

Have a good day !","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon ! &lt;/p&gt;

I'm on a health craze right now thanks to losing a lot of weight before school, and now that I'm living on my own accord, I have to pay for my own groceries too. Im looking to eat both cheap and as healthily as possible, hence the subreddit post. Typically I spend about $25-$30 per week on groceries, and I would like to stay within this limit. 

Are there any suggestions about the best, cheapest, and healthiest foods to buy? I'm interested in possibly going veggie if it's cheaper than buying meats, and I occasionally have access to stores like Sams Club and Costco. 

For a little context, I like to cook, and I try to cook all of my own meals myself, although my cooking supplies are very limited. Essentially all that I have is a microwave, oven, wok, and cast iron pan. I also like to create my own recipes and try new things when cooking.

Delicious. Addictive.


Cook some long grain white rice. I prefer jasmine. I add a generous amount of kosher salt and sesame oil to the water. Once the rice is cooked it can be kept in the fridge to make the fried rice to order. 


In a large skillet on low heat, gently fry 2-4 slices of bacon (your choice how many). Bacon isn’t necessary to this recipe but adds extra umph. Once the bacon is a little bit crispy and a lot chewy, remove from heat and set aside.


With the bacon fat still in the pan, turn up heat to medium high. Add about two cups of cooked rice and stir often.  If you’re skipping the bacon, use your favorite high temp cooking oil. Also, in the efforts of frugality, you can skip the bacon but use bacon fat saved from breakfast. Add enough oil or fat so that your rice isn’t sticking while you stir it. 


Meanwhile, scramble two eggs in a separate pan. This can be done ahead of time if you’d like.  When close to done, chop the egg with your spatula into small pieces.  While you’re at it, slice your cooked bacon into small pieces. 


When the rice is hot, add a 1/2 cup to a cup of chopped kimchi. The more the better, honestly. If your kimchi contains a lot of liquid, you can get away with a 1/2 cup. If your kimchi is dry, add lots of kimchi (around a cup). Stir. Your rice should have a deep orange color to it. Keep stirring. Once hot, incorporate your eggs and bacon. Stir a few more times. Serve. 


 This is a stand alone meal. It makes a very satisfying breakfast or dinner. Can obviously be a side dish but I look at it as a meal.


Kimchi can be made at home quite easily for much cheaper than you can buy it. Also, Korean markets have the cheapest kimchi if you want to purchase it.

Jambalaya Recipe:

* 3 Cups of White Long Grain Rice
* 6-8 Cups of Chicken Stock
* 1-2 lbs of Andouille Sausage (can substitute for any sausage like I had to this week, andouille is just more authentic)
* 28 oz of Crushed Tomatoes
* 4 Green Bell Peppers, diced
* 6 Stalks of Celery, diced
* 1 Large Onion, diced
* 2 Jalapeno Peppers, diced (optional)
* 4 tbsp of olive oil
* 4 tbsp of Cajun Seasoning blend (see below)
* 2-3 Bay Leaves

1. Heat up a large pot (I used a 6 qt Dutch Oven), add your sausage to the pot and cook till browned all the way through. Remove from pot.
2. While the sausage is cooking, prep all your vegis. Dice them into bite size pieces.
3. Pour your olive oil into the pot, then add your vegis. Saute for about 6 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add about a teaspoon of salt to the vegis while cooking to help the onions sweat.
4. Add your stock, tomatoes, Cajun seasoning, and bay leaves to the pot. Turn up the heat to medium high and let it come to a simmer.
5. Lower the heat, to a Low-medium, add your rice, give it a good stir, and cover the pot. Let it simmer for about 25-30 minutes.
6. Give the rice a good stir about every 5 minutes during the cooking process to prevent from sticking to the pot of the pan.
7. Add your sausage back in after cooking the rice. Voila!

&amp;#x200B;

Cajun-Style Chicken Recipe:

* 5 lbs of Chicken Breast
* 4 tbsp of olive oil
* 4 tbsp of Cajun Seasoning Blend

1. Fillet your chicken breast to smaller portion sizes (if necessary), You're aiming for about 6-8oz chicken fillets.
2. Throw your chicken breast in a bag, add your oil and seasonings, and marinate for about 4 hours.
3. Cook how your desire!
   1. I bake mine personally at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.
4. Let chicken cool to room temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

Cajun Seasoning Blend: For those that prefer to make their own, it's very easy!

* 3 Tbsp of Smoked Paprika
* 2 Tbsp of Pepper
* 2 Tbsp of Kosher Salt
* 2 Tbsp of Garlic Powder
* 1 Tbsp of Onion Powder
* 1 Tbsp of Dried Oregano
* 1 Tbsp of Dried Thyme
* 1 Tbsp of Cayenne
* Store any unused seasoning blend in an airtight container and use it next time, or add to meat!

Chipotle Black Beans

Ingredients:
3TBSP Butter
1/2 TSP Red Pepper Flakes 1/2 TSP Black pepper
2 medium purple onions
6 cloves of garlic (2TBSP) 6 Chipotle Peppers
3 Cans of Black Beans
1.5 cups of water
1.5 TSP Salt

1. Coarsely chop two regular (or one large) purple onions
2. Chop 6 cloves of garlic. Or use about 2 TBSP of minced garlic.
3. Melt 3 TBSP butter on medium low in the pot.
4. Add 1⁄2 TSP red pepper flakes
5. Add 1⁄2 TSP black pepper (About 30 cranks on a pepper grinder)
6. Open two cans of black beans &amp; rinse well in strainer
7. Add onions and garlic to the pot. Increase heat to high, and sauté until “clear”
8. Take six medium chipotle peppers &amp; chop finely.
9. Add chipotle peppers to the pot and stir well.
10. Add rinsed black beans to the pot.
11. Add 1.5 cups of water
12. Add 1.5 TSP salt
13. Rinse and add the final can of black beans
14. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring gently.
15. Reduce heat to medium and cover. They need to simmer for at least 30 minutes.

Cilantro Lime Rice (Start after beans have been simmering for 15 minutes)

Ingredients:
3 TBSP Butter
2 TSP Cilantro
2 Cups Basmati Rice
5 TBSP Lime Juice (3 Limes) 3 Cups Water
1.5 TSP Salt

1. Melt 3 TBSP butter on medium
2. Add 2 TSP dried Cilantro
3. Add 2 cups Basmati Rice
4. Stir the rice to mix in the butter
5. Add the 5 TBSP lime juice (or juice of 3 limes)
6. Turn the heat up to high and stir constantly for one to two minutes
7. Add 3 cups of water
8. Add 1.5 tsp of salt
9. Stir and bring to a rolling boil
10. Cover and reduce heat to a simmer (Usually medium or medium low of most stoves)
11. Cook for 12 minutes.
12. Remove from heat and fluff. Put the cover back on and let stand for 3 to 5 minutes. (If the rice isreally moist when you fluff it, it needs to stand for 5 munutes, otherwise it only needs to stand for a few minutes)

This will make enough for me to eat for dinner the entire week. I sometimes will add cheese, avocado, and shredded rotisserie chicken (my dad likes to add a little bit of sour cream) But it’s wonderful even without those things. But be warned it is quite spicy.

4 hard-boiled eggs
2 medium sized chopped onions
2 medium sized chopped tomatoes
1/3 Turmeric Powder
2 Tsp Coriander Powder
1 Tsp Cumin Powder
1 tsp. curry powder
3 tsp. ginger-garlic paste
Salt to taste
fresh coriander leaves to garnish

INSTRUCTIONS
Place water in the sauce pan. Fill half of the pan with water and 2 teaspoon salt. You can also avoid salt but the purpose of salt is to boil water quickly. Once water is boiling put eggs and cook for another 12 minutes.
Put cold water in the pan, remove shell of the egg and keep eggs in a plate.
Heat oil in a pan and when hot, fry the eggs properly until it turns golden color. Slice the egg from middle into two pieces and put it into a plate.

But part of my job is to advise people on their diets and I'm often asked about healthy snacking options. The sad truth is that if something is sold in a store then its probably not very healthy regardless of what's on the label. So I was on another scouting mission last week to see if there were any viable options to add to my list of suggestions and I noticed that pickles have like 0-20 calories in the whole jar. But...pickles are gross (to me).

I stood staring at the jar's ingredients and started to wonder whether I could possibly make a low-calorie snack that didn't taste like feet. I grabbed some ingredients off the shelves and went home to my lab/kitchen.

My first batch is done! I did a red wine version of this and a white wine version to see how it varied and how well each meshed with the ingredients. The white wine version came out tasting like...well, pickles. Good ones, if you like that sort of thing, and my wife is happily munching on those - but it didn't reinvent the wheel or anything. The red wine ones, however, have turned out veddy, veddy niiice.

I'm putting this recipe here for critique. I think it can be better but I'm having a hard time coming up with ideas other than ""double the ingredients"". What would you guys add to this?

A couple of points to keep in mind: a bit of cane sugar is typical when pickling, but my goal is to completely eliminate it; I use as little salt as possible for similar reasons; I'm aiming for a well-mingled savory flavor.

So here's what I played around with:

* cucumber, zucchini squash, carrots (I also included butternut squash, but that didn't do as well; I suspect yellow squash could be right at home here)
* 1 cup red wine vinegar
* 1 cup water
* a generous splash of sherry (port would prolly do well, too)
* minced garlic
* whole peppercorns
* rosemary
* a slight dash of salt

I brought the vinegar/water combo to a light boil and dissolved the salt in it. I chopped the veggies, shoved 'em in a jar, and poured in the partially cooled vinegar water and the wine and the spices. I sealed it, stuck it in the fridge, and pulled it out after a week. (I believe that it'd be ready after three days but I was out of town.)

A few recipe notes: You can use pork tenderloin or chicken with this without needing to modify the recipe much. We had enough leftover for another serving, but it would be pretty easy to increase the servings without adding too much cost. IE, just add another can of navy beans and tomatoes, and more chicken stock and it will take it up to 4-5 servings.

You can also use a can of tomatoes and instead of cherry tomatoes and you can use frozen green beans instead of fresh and save money there! Either way, it's a pretty easy, adaptable recipe that's affordable to make and actually looks kind of fancy!

Recipe here originally: [Pork and Green beans in Fennel-Tomato Broth](https://triedtrue.us/PorkGreenBeans)

## Grade:

Serves: 2-3

Cost: $4.81 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 40 minutes (10 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients Pork and Green Beans in Fennel-Tomato Broth

2 thick, boneless pork chops (ideally with good fat caps) (Or use chicken thighs, breast, or pork tenderloin)

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

3 tablespoons butter (I added for richness, you can omit if you're counting calories)

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

1 head of fennel with fronds

4 cloves garlic, minced

1 jalapeño, trimmed and minced

1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved (Or 1 can diced tomatoes)

10 ounces green beans, trimmed (Or use frozen)

2 cups chicken stock

1 can navy beans, drained

1 teaspoon dry thyme

Crushed red pepper, to taste

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

## Prepare the Fennel:

Pick off and reserve the fennel fronds. Cut the stalks from the bulb and thinly slice the stalks cross-wise. Cut the fennel bulb in half and cut out the core and discard. Slice the bulb into thin wedges.

## Cook the Pork:

Preheat oven to 375ºF. In a wide sauté pan, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until very hot. Pat the pork dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the pork chops in the pan and cook without moving for 5 minutes until very well-browned. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more. Turn the pork chops on their sides and fry the fat caps for 45 seconds. Transfer the pork to a plate and keep the sauté pan on medium heat.

## Fry the Fennel and Onions :

Melt the butter in the sauté pan. Once frothy, add the onions and fennel (sliced stalks and sliced bulb) and cook with for 7-8 minutes until the fennel begins to char and the onions soften.

## Prepare the Broth:

Add the minced garlic and jalapeño and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

Add the cherry tomatoes and toss to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes until just softened. Add the green beans and cook another minute or two. Sprinkle all the vegetables with salt and pepper.

Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits stuck to the bottom. *Note: If you’d like the dish to be a bit more brothy, add more chicken stock.*

Add the drained beans and boil the broth for 5 minutes until reduced slightly. Season with thyme and crushed red pepper.

## Bake the Pork Chops:

Place the pork chops on top of the beans and drizzle the pork with a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the pork chops reach 145ºF.

## Finish the Dish:

Remove the pan from the oven and return to the stovetop. Transfer the pork chops to a plate to rest for 5 minutes. If you’d like to reduce the broth a bit more, turn the pan to medium-high and boil the broth for a few minutes as the pork chops rest.

## To Serve:

Thinly slice the pork chops cross-wise. Ladle the beans and fennel-tomato broth into shallow bowls and arrange the sliced pork on top. Spoon more broth over the pork before serving. Garnish with the reserved fennel fronds. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIC: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/PVGTH7m.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/PVGTH7m.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I've been doing intermittent fasting for a few months now, mostly as an exercise to stop being so chained to the anticipation of my next meal.

Another unintended consequence is that now it's really hard for me to eat a 'normal' amount of calories at once.

And if it requires a lot of cooking/preparation/ingredients, I can't stick to it. I'm also very depressed...lol. It's harder than ever not to eat out of boredom!

I want to be the kind of person who grabs a handful of nuts and is good, but I try to stick to 1500-1800 calories a day, and those are very calorie-dense. It's such a struggle. Any ideas?

I really enjoy this sub.

Any tips or tricks or suggestions you guys have would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Background**

We are a family of 6 and my husband and I both work full time but my husband is a contractor and pay is unreliable, so sometimes we've got two paychecks and sometimes its just the one. I am not much of a cook and I was having a hard time scrambling around for dinner every night after work before we started our new meal planning system last year. I don't love cooking and have really just in the last couple of years started branching out from super basic stuff. This year I started trying to steer everyone in more healthy directions and stop eating out. Turning my kids into salad eaters instead of chicken nuggets and french fry fans has been a challenge but the bigger kids have been game. My husband has some health issues we are trying to help combat with diet and exercise. Nobody is overweight yet but it felt like we were heading there and in general I'd just like us all to be healthier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our System**

We decided that everyone in our house who is old enough and responsible enough to operate the stove has one night each week where they are in charge of planning and cooking dinner. They have to let me know by Sunday what they want to make for the next week so I can plan my shopping trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Our weekly plan typically looks like;

*  Sunday - Slow Cooker meal.
*  Monday - 16 year old.
*  Tuesday - 12 year old.
*  Weds - Me (I usually make a chicken or pork chop one pan meal in the oven).
*  Thurs - Husband (he’s been making a lot of fish+salad meals lately).
*  Friday - Pizza night.
*  Saturday- the 9 or 7 year old plans the meal but my husband or I help cook it.

&amp;#x200B;

[I use this template that I made in Google Sheets to plug everything in and plan what to buy for the week.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nRj7PBdUXfunGTCqiPwZnzm-uZa2qDEYoK5gTypRwww) I usually add the recipe links if applicable so I can reference them at the store.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stuff we need help with:**

&amp;#x200B;

Recipes

This system has been going really well for the most part! Everyone has been a good sport and even excited that its their turn to cook dinner. The kids and I have like 2-3 meals each that we make on our nights though. It gets kind of boring. My husband is better at making different things but mostly makes stuff that he likes (and the kids have to choke down). I'd like to have a stockpile of easy healthy tasty recipe options to rotate throughout the month that would also be easy for the kids to make. I tend to get super overwhelmed on pinterest.

&amp;#x200B;

Budget

My grocery budget is usually about $200 every two weeks. I find myself stopping at one of the bigger chain stores a lot during the week though to grab items that weren't readily available at Aldi and end up spending up to another $50 a week sometimes. I know this might seem like a big food budget to you guys but for 6 people it seems like I'm still running low on food by the time my next paycheck/shopping trip rolls around. Planning meals has helped a lot but it still seems like I could figure out a way to make it better.

* 2 x white onion
* whole bag of carrot chips
* 6 chicken thighs
* chicken stock
* 5 cloves garlic
* 3 cups rice (Jasmine, in my case)
* parsley
* green onion
* chili powder, salt, pepper, cumin seed, turmeric, whatever you want to flavor it with honestly.

Directions:

1. Dice both onions and cut carrot chips along the edges to form match sticks, then cut these matchsticks in half
2. chop parsley
3. slice 4 garlic gloves
4. cut chicken thighs to 1"" cubes
5. fill pan with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan
6. add veggies in and let them soften on low heat
7. add chicken thighs and cook til white on the outside
8. put veggie + chicken mixture into soup pot (!) 
9. add your choice of rice, I did 3 cups but will go with 2 cups next time
10. add 1.5 cups of stock for every cup of rice
11. set heat to high til it begins to boil, then reduce heat to low 
12. add chopped parsley and spices
13. let simmer for 20 mins then add green onion to finished product

&lt;li&gt;fill pan with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add veggies in and let them soften on low heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add chicken thighs and cook til white on the outside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put veggie + chicken mixture into soup pot (!) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add your choice of rice, I did 3 cups but will go with 2 cups next time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add 1.5 cups of stock for every cup of rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set heat to high til it begins to boil, then reduce heat to low &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add chopped parsley and spices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let simmer for 20 mins then add green onion to finished product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took me all of 30 mins to chop and prep and costed me ~$14 for 5 meals ($2.80 a meal)&lt;/p&gt;

**Notes** 
 
The chicken goes well with practically anything if you're feeling adventurous. 
  
Tortillas are easy, but tedious to make. I am lazy and just buy them when it's for a crowd. The best way to cook them is to grill them either on the [Comal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comal_(cookware), or directly on the electric burner (make sure it's clean). Whatever you do, do *NOT* leave them unattended. Every time a tortilla burns, an abuela loses a chancla.  
  
When using granulated garlic, keep in mind that it is *significantly* more potent than garlic powder; a little goes a long way. The best place to buy it is actually arabic markets (super cheap, higher quality).  
  
There are millions of ways to make salsa-- try them all! Salsa verde, salsa rojo, salsa fresca, pineapple salsa, mango salsa... The world is your [molcajete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molcajete)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of posts around Reddit for American-style tacos...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coat and marinate chicken for 3-4 hours. Roast on 350° for 45-ish minutes, shred. Top with lime juice, cebollas, cilantro, and salsa verde.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Chorizo&lt;br/&gt;
Serves: 5&lt;br/&gt;
Time: 30 minutes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
5 lbs of beef chorizo&lt;br/&gt;
One bulb of garlic&lt;br/&gt;
5 spring onions  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grill chorizo until it starts to crumble, then add diced garlic and onions. Cook until it starts to crisp.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sides&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Guacamole&lt;br/&gt;
Size: 6 servings&lt;br/&gt;
Total Time: 30 minutes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3 large avocados&lt;br/&gt;
4 spring onions&lt;br/&gt;
3 roma tomatoes&lt;br/&gt;
1 garlic bulb&lt;br/&gt;
2 limes&lt;br/&gt;
Tajin&lt;br/&gt;
3 poblanos (optional)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice the onions and place in the molcajete. Squeeze lime juice over them, and let sit. Chop the tomatoes into chunks, salt and roast with poblanos if desired, and set aside. Dice the garlic bulb and throw in molcajete. Peel avocados and mash, leaving it a bit chunky. Toss in rest of ingredients, and lightly mix. Add lime juice as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Salsa Borracha &lt;br/&gt;
Serves: 5 people&lt;br/&gt;
Time: 30 minutes   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 red tomatoes&lt;br/&gt;
2 jalapeños &lt;br/&gt;
5 small spring onions&lt;br/&gt;
1 garlic bulb&lt;br/&gt;
1 can of Mexican beer&lt;br/&gt;
1 lime&lt;br/&gt;
5 TB of olive oil&lt;br/&gt;
Cilantro&lt;br/&gt;
Salt  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grill all of the vegetables and garlic until they start to blister. Grind the onions and garlic in the molcajete. Heat the oil on the stove until very hot. Peel the excess skin and stem off of the peppers and grind into the molcajete. Do the same with the tomatoes, then add the cilantro leaves, beer, and salt. Grind once more. Add hot oil to the salsa and stir. Best if served the next day &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Tortilla chips&lt;br/&gt;
Size: 6 servings&lt;br/&gt;
Total Time: 45 minutes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
24 corn tortillas&lt;br/&gt;
Sunflower oil&lt;br/&gt;
Salt&lt;br/&gt;
Granulated garlic  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 450°. Make (or buy from the store) and rip tortillas into 4-6 pieces and place on a baking sheet without overlapping. Drizzle oil on top, and sprinkle salt and garlic. Roast until lightly brown, about 10-15 minutes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Elotes&lt;br/&gt;
Size: 6 cobs&lt;br/&gt;
Total Time: 10 minutes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
6 corn on the cobs&lt;br/&gt;
1 jar of mayonnaise&lt;br/&gt;
7 limes&lt;br/&gt;
1 package of cotija&lt;br/&gt;
Chili powder&lt;br/&gt;
Salt  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Husk and clean the corn. Boil on medium-high for three minutes. Remove and let cool for a minute. Slather on mayonnaise, cotija, chili powder, lime juice, and a little salt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desserts&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish: Horchata&lt;br/&gt;
Serves: 5&lt;br/&gt;
Time: 1 hour  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
8.5 cups of hot water&lt;br/&gt;
1 cup of uncooked, white long grain rice&lt;br/&gt;
2 sticks of cinnamon&lt;br/&gt;
1 can of evaporated milk&lt;br/&gt;
1 can of condensed milk&lt;br/&gt;
1 tsp of vanilla extract &lt;br/&gt;
1 cup of ice  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directions:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blitz rice until almost powdery. Soak the rice and cinnamon sticks in hot water until bloated. Remove sticks, and blend rice/water until smooth. Squeeze the water through a cheesecloth, add both milks and vanilla to the water. Chill, and serve.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chicken goes well with practically anything if you&amp;#39;re feeling adventurous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tortillas are easy, but tedious to make. I am lazy and just buy them when it&amp;#39;s for a crowd. The best way to cook them is to grill them either on the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comal_(cookware""&gt;Comal&lt;/a&gt;, or directly on the electric burner (make sure it&amp;#39;s clean). Whatever you do, do &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; leave them unattended. Every time a tortilla burns, an abuela loses a chancla.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using granulated garlic, keep in mind that it is &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; more potent than garlic powder; a little goes a long way. The best place to buy it is actually arabic markets (super cheap, higher quality).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of ways to make salsa-- try them all! Salsa verde, salsa rojo, salsa fresca, pineapple salsa, mango salsa... The world is your &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molcajete""&gt;molcajete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone! My husband and I have been working on getting our food prep game down and we finally have a pretty healthy routine that's helped us stop eating out so much. Some tips I learned from you all that really worked for us:

1. Muffin trays! They're a Godsend! I make a huge batch of rice and beans and freeze ""pucks"" and pop them in the freezer. 2 pucks is a good serving size.

2. Smoothies! That way if you eat like shit the rest of the day you started it out right. I also add cooked then frozen quinoa to my smoothie as one redditor suggested and it's good and filling. 

3. Bomb ass chicken! This recipe changed the game for us, so here it is. 

Put frozen chicken in a pressure cooker with 1/8 C  salt, 1/8 C sugar and 1/8 C soy sauce PER 2 cups of water necessary to fill pressure cooker. For me that's usually 4 chicken thighs with 2 cups of water. 

Less seasonings can be used if your sensitive to seasoning but I dont add any salt other than this. The pressure cooker forces the brine to permeate all of the meat. 

Pressure cook that for 2 pressure cycles on low, 15psi or so. Then once it's done, turn a pan on HIGH heat preferable with peanut or avocado oil, get out a pan lid (read: grease sheild) and flash fry your already cooked chicken for a minute or so on either side to quickly crisp up the outside. 

Imo it's amazing because pressure cookers already make things so juicy, then it gets infused with a brine, and flash fried. Super yum.

* Add the puréed beans, the other two cans of drained beans, broth, rosemary, thyme, crushed red pepper, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
* Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium low, remove the lid, and allow it to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Grocery Outlet and Trader Joe's are my go-tos, as is Costco for bulk items. Thought I'd share some of these shopping lists, as it might be helpful for others keeping to varied (and cheap!) healthy eats!

Last shopping trip ($30.86)

-Five lbs. chicken thighs (I bag and freeze them to keep them fresh)

-1 lb. long grain brown rice

-10 oz. worchestershire sauce

-18 oz. Bob's Gluten Free Oat Bran

-Green onions bunch

-2 lbs. carrots

-Pineapple

-10 lbs. Russet potatoes

-3 Romaine hearts

-Spaghetti squash

-Sweet Dumpling squash

-Uchiki Kuri squash

-Dozen eggs

Other normal buys: Coconut milk, gluten reduced bread/wraps (spelt sourdough, rice tortillas), olive oil, coconut oil, baking additives, alternative flours, oranges, goat cheese/brie, blueberries, rosemary, sweet potatoes, thyme, basmati/wild rice, tomatoes, low fat mayo, basil, tilapia, turkey breast lunch meat, olives, coffee, loose-leaf tea, tortilla chips, veggie chips, yellow squash, zucchini, sprouts, balsamic, eggs, lemon, lime, ginger, turnips, parsnips, eggplant, green beans, bell peppers, grapes, rhubarb, kiwi, strawberries, polenta, veggie oil butter, soy sauce, Sriracha, maple syrup, 75% cacao dark chocolate, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, etc.

I prep my foods on the weekends so I'm ready to go when the work week starts. Cook the chicken in two batches - half for dinners, half to shred with lunch. I intersperse the oat bran and fresh fruit for breakfast. The first weekend I baked the sweet dumpling squash and the uchiki kuri squash. Both are for dinners and some lunch. I used coconut milk and some great spices/herbs to whip up an early fall bisque with the sweet dumpling - the uchiki kuri I used some of the inside squash for mixed meals, and then stuffed the squash with rice, tomato, herbs and sauteed carrots. The second weekend I'll bake the spaghetti squash, which is a replacement for my old pasta cravings. I use the lettuce for lunch salads. The potatoes I slice and bake as homemade fries, boil for potato meals, cook in soups, and include in mixed-ingredient lunches/dinners. 10 lbs. is a lot and will last me a couple months. The carrots also go in soups, are shredded in salads, or braised or sauteed as a dinner side. The rice was stuffed, will go in soups, and be cooked with the chicken. I'll use extra pineapple as a snack.

This bill is under my norm, since the specialty items and monthly staples aren't pricy. (Olive oil, veggie butter, bread, wraps, coconut milk stock, coffee, and baking additives are a bit more.) Still, I do spend under $100 every month, or $50 every 2 1/2 weeks. I price everything out and take advantage of the fruits and veggies in season. The key is to vary with lots of spices and meal plans, freeze and cook items to prevent anything going bad, and always have certain ingredients left over to be used in the following month(s). 

I don't usually buy chicken or beef stock for soups and bisques. I use coconut milks and other ingredients to thicken or miso paste for brothy soups (this is high in sodium, but still good for low FODMAP).

I do bake my own muffins and bars. Also some deserts (brownies, cakes, reduced custards, gluten free pies). I make popsicles with extra fruit and berries. I also bake deep dish and casserole dinners.

My wraps and sandwiches I tend to toast with a panini grill. For salads I use lettuce or mixed greens, tomatoes, chopped olives, shredded chicken, diced walnuts or pine nuts, hard boiled eggs, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette, with variations.

Anyway, lots of options.

Ingredients:

\-1 lb chorizo, $3

\-1 bunch cilantro, $1 (I only used \~20% of bunch of cilantro but it's the smallest quantity I can buy).

\-Corn tortillas, \~$1 (Ridiculously small corn tortillas that we had in the house).

Instructions:

1. Brown chorizo, then drain most of the grease.
2. Add some olive oil and fry up some corn tortillas to your liking.
3. Rinse off / cut up / prepare cilantro to your liking (or whatever other things you want to add to your tacos, onions are good too.)

Rather than waste them I decided to make a cheap dipping sauce of balsamic vinegar, a bit of olive oil, and some salt. Holy crap, you guys. This makes radishes more than acceptable. Get fancy and throw some rosemary or Italian seasoning in there too. Go crazy, kid! 

I'm just stoked I found a healthy crunch snack that takes like 45 seconds to prepare, is easily made with basic kitchen staple ingredients, and is hella cheap compared to other alternatives that are WAY less good for me. So hey, give it a shot and enjoy! :D","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idk why but late at night I get really munchy for crunchy foods. I&amp;#39;m definitely a hard candy cruncher but since cutting it out, I&amp;#39;m missing that experience. Obvious choices like nuts just don&amp;#39;t cut it so I&amp;#39;ve turned towards vegetables. Cranberries are great but they&amp;#39;re seasonal and super bitter. Still, it feeds the urge and limits my quantities real fast because I can only tolerate a few at a time, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a new cook and poor college student, so I lurk on this sub a lot but never really say anything (I suppose that changes today). I made some changes to my diet and it really had a positive effect on me, so I thought I would share in case it could help others too. This summer I read **Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us** by Michael Moss, which was a book I'd seen mentioned either here or on r/52book, and I learned that a lot of the foods I *thought* were healthy were actually killing me slowly. Sugary ""healthy"" cereal, ready meals, prepackaged Smartfood popcorn (my ultimate vice), etc. It wasn't fun, but I cut those foods out of my diet and started paying attention to food labels. Not in an ""I can't eat anything that's not xyz"" kind of way - more of in an ""I could eat this, but my body is really not made to *sustainably* eat this"" kind of way. Since there weren't lots of ready-made, affordable healthy meals at the grocery store, I decided to buy a Home and Gardens cookbook and start making my meals at home. What a difference that has made.

I have been cooking a lot lately, and it has changed my days for the better. I vary my diet most days of the week and get creative with food to make it interesting. It takes more focus than I thought to cook well, but I like that because it's a nice change from concentrating on school work. Being active for an hour or two in the kitchen means I am not sitting on the couch watching re-runs, and I really like that change of pace (not that watching TV instead is bad, just different strokes for different folks). It feels like I'm constantly learning, and the best part is how I feel after I eat the food: proud, healthy, active, and full. I used to eat cheap pasta and canned soup all the time to save money, but that was negated by all the snacks I bought to fill myself up because I felt constantly hungry. Now I eat meals that have a little bit of everything: veggies, meat, spices, butter, broths, etc. I feel amazing. I have so much energy, I am in better shape, and I don't crave sugary foods very much anymore. Actually, when I do try them, I don't feel well at all.

I'm writing this because I used to be someone who thought they were eating cheaply and relatively healthy, and I actually wasn't. Spending an extra couple of bucks at the store to get spices and vegetables has made my life so much better, and I have also learned a valuable new hobby that has increased my confidence and gotten me in better shape. If you are where I was, know that it can be an incremental adjustment and you don't have to cut out your favorite snacks, just moderate them. Know what is in your food, and don't feel bad when you have a cheat day here or there. Cooking meals ends up being quite cheap, and eating well will yield so many dividends.

Note: If you are looking at a recipe and are put off trying it because you have to buy things like heavy cream, broth, flour, or spices, know that once you have those things, you can have them in many different recipes and they last a long time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone!

I just spent 2 hours cooking for two months of dog food. My 50 lb dog eats 2-3 cups of dog food/day, depending on what we’re doing. I paid $40 total for 5 lbs of lean ground beef (discount section), 10 lbs of potatoes. 2 lbs of pumpkin seeds, 2 lbs of split peas, 5 lbs of carrots, 2 tins of sardines, 1 dozen eggs, and ground flax. I make sauerkraut in big batches so I had 3 cups on hand but otherwise would have used lemon juice for vitamin C. 

I used a pressure cooker to cook the peas, carrots (skin on, organic) and pumpkin seeds with a few cups of water. Meanwhile, I boiled the potatoes (skin on, rinsed). When it was all cooked, i spread it out on sheet pans and cooled it down. 

In a food processor, i mixed the sardines, sauerkraut, eggs and flax and transferred to a bowl.

I mixed all ingredients together into a big bowl and used the food processor to mix each batch. Not sure about your dog but mine’s picky about chunks of carrots. 

The processing took about 20 min. 

Then i spread it back into the sheet pans and tubbed up the rest in old yogurt containers. Everything except this week’s meals went into the freezer. When the sheets are frozen, i’m going to cut the frozen block into patties and stack them in plastic bags. I tend to reuse produce bags for this purpose. 

Then, every sunday, pull out your dogs meals for  the week! 

This recipe should work great for dogs experiencing dental problems.

Edit: A couple of people have asked for my meal plan and I already posted this in one comment, but I'll put it here too so more people can see it:

I only eat three times a day with no snacks since I have a really busy schedule, although I will carry a granola bar in my backpack in case I really need something. This is my meal plan for this week, but I'm hoping to think up some more meals for the future so I don't get bored.

Breakfast: My absolute favorite thing in the world is oatmeal with fruit, specifically strawberries. So I always take a package of strawberries, rinse and chop them all up at once, and keep them in the fridge so I can just throw my oatmeal in the microwave and then quickly stir in some strawberries. You could also add fruit to just regular cereal if that's more your speed.

Lunch: Either grill some chicken in a pan, or throw it in the oven with some oil and bake it. Once it's done, shred it, and use that to make sandwiches--my fave is pita bread with shredded cheese and spinach. Some blackberries and a boiled egg on the side.

Dinner: Baked chicken with rice and vegetables. I'm going to oven fry my chicken tenders this week (slather them in mayo, then coat with breadcrumbs that have been seasoned to taste. Bake at ~375° F [190° C] for ~40 minutes, or til it's done. Works best with breasts/tenders but can work with legs/wings too, although you may have to adjust cooking times). Sooooo good

One recipe makes 6 and comes out to around 50 cents a serving. I love to serve this with a scoop of yogurt and whatever frozen fruit I have. It tastes like an oatmeal cookie and banana bread had a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

PS: given all 4 of my parents were bakers at a point of their lives, I'm really not creative when it comes to breakfasts and dinners (lunch is the main meal where I live) - just put something on a bread most of the time.

I am 9 weeks pregnant (high risk) and have been spotting, and am now on bedrest for at least the next 5 days.

I have a few health issues, including T2 diabetes,  but have been taken off all but my thyroid meds, as they were bad for the baby. Without my meds, I have been having a hard time keeping my blood sugar levels in check, so I have been doing more walking, which has been a great help.

Now that I am unable to walk, and laying in bed all day not expending any energy, I am very worried about keeping my levels in check.

I am totally overwhelmed by the thought of buying these things! I didn’t know how good I had it and how expensive things like spices are!!

I live in Canada and have access to things like Bulk Barn (obviously sells things in bulk), Costco, and then other generic grocery stores. 

Please share your tips and tricks when it comes to stocking up my supplies :)

I have soups, frozen meals, prawns, turkey, chicken, chili, etc. that I've bought on sale and froze. I also have stocked my pantry with things that I use on a regular basis like tuna, coconut milk, canned soup etc. I don't waste this stuff because it's in my pantry or in my freezer and I definitely use it for a rainy day or when I don't feel like cooking.

But I am very underweight and my body quite literally has no fat, even the fat that used to be on the back of my thighs is gone. And recently I've lost 5kg in 1-2 weeks which raises red flags for me. Keeping a constant weight 48-53kg is really important to me if I can't put it on.

Hence why I want to get fat.

Also I do already eat healthy, just not enough.

I just found freezer burnt chicken and pork in my freezer that I had forgotten about. Google tells me it's safe to eat, but all of the cooking suggestions involve a crock pot or slow cooker. I don't have either of those. It would be impractical for me to buy one.

I am completely out of my element. I rarely cook with meat and I rarely cook from frozen. I don't want these to go to waste, though, especially with how much meat consumption goes towards global warming.

In particular, steaming and boiling should be avoided, with a few exceptions. Been loving broccoli the past few days and these are my go-to recipes.

**Sautéed broccoli (with vegan option)**

Get some pancetta or even some proper streaky bacon. Cut the pancetta or bacon in strips or small pieces. Heat a large pan, add a teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil and the pancetta, then render out as much fat as possible. Add the broccoli, a pinch of salt (not too much, the pancetta is already salty) and toss for a couple of minutes. Then add a splash of water, reduce the heat, and cover with a lid. Cook until the broccoli are tender, adding a pinch of pepper in the last few minutes, and all of the water has been absorbed (check the pan a few times and add more water if needed to prevent the broccoli from burning). In the last minute or two, turn back up again the heat and sauté to kinda roast a bit the broccoli. If you don’t eat meat or pork, just use more oil and add a crushed garlic clove, let it fry for some 30 seconds and add the broccoli.

**Broccoli soup (vegan, with non-vegetarian option)**

This is in particular great with the peeled stalks and only a few florets. If you made a big pan of broccoli florets, save the stalks and a few of the florets for this soup. Dice the broccoli stalks, and cut the florets so that they are fairly small; dice also one or two potatoes (about the same weight as the broccoli). Mince half an onion. Pour a little extra-virgin olive oil in a pot, add the onion and cook until it starts to turn golden. Now add the broccoli and stir them with the onion and oil for a few minutes. Add enough water to cover all vegetables, the diced potatoes (check the water level), a pinch of salt, and a couple of black pepper grains that you will put in a piece of gauze to retrieve them before serving. Simmer until all vegetables are tender. Remove the pepper. If you prefer smooth soups, blend everything and simmer on for 5 minutes. If not, just serve and enjoy. If you like, you can substitute half the oil with some pancetta fat (or streaky bacon). Just render the pancetta cut in thin strips until it has leaked all the fat, remove the pancetta bits and leave them aside. Follow the recipe and sprinkle the pancetta on each bowl.

**Pasta e broccoli (vegan and not vegan, to your liking)** 

Start a pot of water boiling. Add salt, then drop some maccheroni pasta and an equal volume of broccoli. When your pasta is about 4–5 minutes from being done, heat a very large pan (something that will accomodate all of the pasta and vegetables), add some extravirgin olive oil, add an achovy filet per portion (this is optional, if you don’t eat fish just skip it), then add garlic and chili to your taste. When the pasta is still a minute or two from being done, retrieve a ladleful of its cooking water, drain but leave it still dripping, and dump it into the pan. Sauté, adding water to losen the mixture and to cook on, and add a handful of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino (again, optional). Serve immediately, piping hot.

Hi guys,

After your enthusiasm to try some of my recipes, I got straight to work. Here's the link to my original post if you missed it - [https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/czxuoo/studentbudget\_cookbook/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/czxuoo/studentbudget_cookbook/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

Please send me feedback, I will appreciate it a lot! Also, You could make this same recipe with tinned tuna, probably about 2 tins. I also made up a nutrition label but I have no idea how to attach it, so let me know and I can send it to you. It is about **344 calories** per serving.

**Spicy Pan Fried Fish Cakes**

Makes about 4 large fish cakes. Serves 2.

|Ingredients|Cost ($)|
|:-|:-|
|450g Fresh Hake|4.03|
|5 boiled baby potatoes|0.28|
|2 jalapenos (optional) finely chopped|0.30|
|A bunch of parsley. chopped|0.34|
|A lemon (optional) sliced into quarters for serving|0.41|
|Recipe Total|6.3|
|Price per serving|3.15|

**Method:**

In a frying pan, heat a tablespoon or so of oil at medium to high heat. While waiting, sprinkle a generous amount of salt and pepper over the fish as well as some cayenne pepper. Once the pan is hot, add the fish and cook it evenly by flipping it over with a spatula every few minutes. You don’t need to worry if the fish starts falling apart, it will be shredded later anyway.

In a large bowl, mash the baby potatoes (you can peel them before you cook them but I normally leave the skin on because 1. It lowers the GI index and 2. I can’t be bothered to peel them). With a wooden spoon or your hands, mix in the finely chopped onions, jalapenos and parsley.

Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it in the same bowl and the potato mixture. With a fork to aid the shredding process, combine the mashed potato mixture with the fish. It should flake off and combine easily. At this point you can taste the mixture and decide whether it needs more seasoning.

Once everything is combined thoroughly, you should be able to form the fishcakes with your hands by pressing the mixture into a rounded, patty-like shape. This recipe should make about 4 large cakes or 8 small ones.

In a clean frying pan, add enough oil so that the bottom is mostly covered. Heat the pan on medium heat and then carefully place the fishcakes in the oil. When you first put them in, it is helpful to move the pan back and forth so that they slide around a bit. This helps them form a crust at the bottom without sticking to the pan. When they are nice and brown, turn them over and do the other side. I like them quite crispy so I may even do a second round of flipping. When you are happy with the crust, remove them from the heat and dab any excess oil with a paper towel. Serve with a fresh salad or in a nice bun as a fish burger. My favourite side is Kenji Lopez-Alt’s Mexican Street Corn Salad.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s way cheaper, does not require cooking, can be eaten with rice/buckwheat, nuts and vegetables. It also contains quite a lot of protein. I am a lean 29-year-old male, have a sedentary office job, after which I go for a walk or do some push ups and pull ups, meaning that I should mind my protein intake, but I am not an athlete.

* 2 scallions, roughly chopped
* 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced into thick coins
* Salt

Note: The chicken I used was closer to 5 or 6 lbs. I boiled it for a few minutes longer and then left it in the pot for about an hour and it turned out fine. 

**Recipe:**

Bring a deep pot of water to a rolling boil (make sure you don’t overfill the pot—the chicken will displace a good amount of water). Add the scallions, ginger and a few large pinches of salt. *Carefully* place the chicken in the pot breast side up. It’s fine if the water does not completely cover the entire chicken.  


Place the lid on and let the chicken boil for 10 minutes. Shut off the heat and allow the pot to sit, covered, for 50 more minutes.

Remove chicken to an ice bath to cool. Once cold, remove from ice bath and pat dry. You may now consider lightly coating the exterior with toasted sesame oil and a sprinkle of salt.

Hi guys,

After your enthusiasm to try some of my recipes, I got straight to work. Here's the link to my original post if you missed it - [https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/czxuoo/studentbudget\_cookbook/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/czxuoo/studentbudget_cookbook/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). 

Please send me feedback, I will appreciate it a lot! Also, You could make this same recipe with tinned tuna, probably about 2 tins. I also made up a nutrition label but I have no idea how to attach it, so let me know and I can send it to you. It is about **344 calories** per serving.

**Spicy Pan Fried Fish Cakes** 

Makes about 4 large fish cakes. Serves 2. 

|Ingredients |Cost ($)|
|:-|:-|
|450g Fresh Hake |4.03|
|5 boiled baby potatoes |0.28|
|2 jalapenos (optional) finely chopped |0.30|
|A bunch of parsley. chopped|0.34|
|A lemon (optional) sliced into quarters for serving |0.41 |
|Recipe Total|6.3|
|Price per serving |3.15|

**Method:**

In a frying pan, heat a tablespoon or so of oil at medium to high heat. While waiting, sprinkle a generous amount of salt and pepper over the fish as well as some cayenne pepper. Once the pan is hot, add the fish and cook it evenly by flipping it over with a spatula every few minutes. You don’t need to worry if the fish starts falling apart, it will be shredded later anyway. 

In a large bowl, mash the baby potatoes (you can peel them before you cook them but I normally leave the skin on because 1. It lowers the GI index and 2. I can’t be bothered to peel them). With a wooden spoon or your hands, mix in the finely chopped onions, jalapenos and parsley. 

Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it in the same bowl and the potato mixture. With a fork to aid the shredding process, combine the mashed potato mixture with the fish. It should flake off and combine easily. At this point you can taste the mixture and decide whether it needs more seasoning. 

Once everything is combined thoroughly, you should be able to form the fishcakes with your hands by pressing the mixture into a rounded, patty-like shape. This recipe should make about 4 large cakes or 8 small ones.

In a clean frying pan, add enough oil so that the bottom is mostly covered. Heat the pan on medium heat and then carefully place the fishcakes in the oil. When you first put them in, it is helpful to move the pan back and forth so that they slide around a bit. This helps them form a crust at the bottom without sticking to the pan. When they are nice and brown, turn them over and do the other side. I like them quite crispy so I may even do a second round of flipping. When you are happy with the crust, remove them from the heat and dab any excess oil with a paper towel. Serve with a fresh salad or in a nice bun as a fish burger. My favourite side is Kenji Lopez-Alt’s Mexican Street Corn Salad.

Pretty easy to make, i started making it 3 years ago when i was still in college.

INGREDIENTS:

- 1lb Italian Sausage or Turkey Sausage 
- 4 cups of Chicken Broth
- 1 Cup of Whipping Cream
- 2-3 Russet Potatoes or 4-5 White potatoes 
- 1 cup of crushed kale
- Optional: Minced Garlic, Red Pepper Flakes, Onion Powder

1. Start of with frying the sausage until its cooked through. Drain it and transfer to a pot. While that cooks, dice up the potatoes. If you have red pepper, sprinkle it over the sausage.

2. In the pot pour in the 4 cups of chicken broth and mix in the potatoes. Let that cook for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft when poked. 

4. Once its soft, throw in the kale.

5. Pour in the cup of whipping cream, this gives the color, let it simmer on low heat for a little while. Occasionally stir, and thats it.

Again, a very versatile soup i'd say. You can use different greens, or omit the sausage entirly and substitute with a mix of spicy seasonings to give the same ""kick"". I just had an idea of making ""spicy sauteed mushrooms"" and using that in place of the sausage for an vegetarian variant.

Pair this with some breadsticks and wine and you got a nice lil Dinner.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve been to Olive Garden, then you deff have had this. Pretty easy to make, i started making it 3 years ago when i was still in college.&lt;/p&gt;

As a student I don’t have tons of money to spend so I would really like to do a bit of meal prep, in order not to buy every lunch meal from fast foods or shops. Meal preping would also help me not being dependent of the overcrowded kitchen during meal times.

Do you have any ideas of easy meals I could cook in advance that don’t require any freezing and that I could save for a few days ? I won’t have access to a freezer. Every meal prep recipe I see seems to be made for freezing.

You can also freeze hummus (which I didn’t know until recently) so you can make big batches and defrost whenever you need it.   

What I love about hummus wraps is that they are so versatile! You can basically add whatever you have on hand to it and it’ll turn out pretty tasty. Lately, I’ve putting quinoa, spinach, carrots, peppers, and sprouts in. It’s also great with lentils. For the week, I batch prep the separate ingredients like quinoa or lentils, and because they are so versatile, you can use them through other things too. Also, this is an aside but it is extremely cheap and cost effective to sprout your own sprouts!

You can also freeze hummus (which I didn’t know until recently) so you can make big batches and defrost whenever you need it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I love about hummus wraps is that they are so versatile! You can basically add whatever you have on hand to it and it’ll turn out pretty tasty. Lately, I’ve putting quinoa, spinach, carrots, peppers, and sprouts in. It’s also great with lentils. For the week, I batch prep the separate ingredients like quinoa or lentils, and because they are so versatile, you can use them through other things too. Also, this is an aside but it is extremely cheap and cost effective to sprout your own sprouts! All you need is a jar and either a sprouting lid or a DIY mesh lid and rinse the sprouts with water for a few days. Sprouts in wraps like this are my favorite because they add a nice crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone. 

I’m a final year undergrad student, and although I’m doing a BSc in Genetics and Human Biology, I love cooking. 
Being a student, I don’t always have the cash to buy top quality ingredients, but I like to think I’m a pretty good cook and can make the cheaper stuff taste good. 
I’ve been thinking of writing a cookbook for other people low on cash that would include the price I paid for each of the ingredients in a recipe (so also approximate total cost of meal as well) and then of course the recipe. 

I wanted to maybe divide it into sections like “breakfast/lunch/dinner” and then within those sections like “beginning of the month/middle of the month/end of month” for humour. 

I was wondering if any of you would be interested in becoming sort of like recipe testers, so lets say once a week I post a recipe and you guys make it and see if it’s any good/give me advice on how to improve it.

Let me know what you think!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT:

Edit:  Sorry for the exctra ""c"" in the title.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the disappointments from my slow cooker creations is that I don&amp;#39;t eat things as timely as I could, then I start to distrust the safety of my food at an uncertain point in time.  I&amp;#39;m not terribly afraid of eating slightly spoiled food, it&amp;#39;s definitely less than ideal, but if I had a better understanding of how long my food should be good to eat I feel like I could shed some apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi all,

I'm trying to gain weight (20-30 lbs) over the next few years. I've bulked a few times before, but I always get sick of it and then quit. I've gained 30+ lbs before.

These days recent blood glucose tests have shown me that I'm borderline pre-diabetic. My glucose levels range from 93-102.

My doctor is 0% worried, and just told me to watch my diet. This means that I have to eat mostly low carb (\~100g of carbs per day).

I used to rely heavily on carbs in order to gain weight, so now I've got some questions about a sample daily meal plan. I've linked a Google Drive spreadsheet below:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdZhjuFb\_nNWXBQr8LLUuCeRddQB9OpZnkzzvMXZFoQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdZhjuFb_nNWXBQr8LLUuCeRddQB9OpZnkzzvMXZFoQ/edit?usp=sharing)

I'm a bit worried about going over 100g of carbs per day, but I also don't want to eat too much fat/saturated fat. There's a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.

I need to eat around 2800 calories per day in order to gain. My TDEE is Almost 2400 calories.

Anyone have any recommendations that can easily increase my calories by 800? I'm currently at around 2000 per day. I removed peanuts because they're so high in fat. A lot of the high caloric foods mentioned in posts on this sub recommend high fat snacks/meals. Anyone concerned about saturated fats, etc?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 years old / Male / 141 lbs / 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to gain weight (20-30 lbs) over the next few years. I&amp;#39;ve bulked a few times before, but I always get sick of it and then quit. I&amp;#39;ve gained 30+ lbs before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days recent blood glucose tests have shown me that I&amp;#39;m borderline pre-diabetic. My glucose levels range from 93-102.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor is 0% worried, and just told me to watch my diet. This means that I have to eat mostly low carb (~100g of carbs per day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to rely heavily on carbs in order to gain weight, so now I&amp;#39;ve got some questions about a sample daily meal plan. I&amp;#39;ve linked a Google Drive spreadsheet below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdZhjuFb_nNWXBQr8LLUuCeRddQB9OpZnkzzvMXZFoQ/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdZhjuFb_nNWXBQr8LLUuCeRddQB9OpZnkzzvMXZFoQ/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit worried about going over 100g of carbs per day, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to eat too much fat/saturated fat. There&amp;#39;s a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to eat around 2800 calories per day in order to gain. My TDEE is Almost 2400 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any recommendations that can easily increase my calories by 800? I&amp;#39;m currently at around 2000 per day. I removed peanuts because they&amp;#39;re so high in fat. A lot of the high caloric foods mentioned in posts on this sub recommend high fat snacks/meals. Anyone concerned about saturated fats, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

Ingredients:

1 big tomato, or a few Romano tomato's, finely chopped.

3 stalks green onion (white onion will be to intense, but if you're into that....), finely chopped.

1 handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped.

2 cloves garlic (or garlic powder, not garlic salt!), finely chopped.

1 small can of tomato sauce (yes, tomato sauce).

1 to 2 Jalapeno peppers, finely chopped.

1 good squeeze of half a lemon.

lots of salt

Directions:

* Put all ingredients except jalapeno's in a bowl, mix it all up. 
* Add water to get the consistency you like, just the tomato sauce will make it way to thick.
* Add a good amount of salt to your liking. You are going to be adding lots of it to get a good taste.
* Jalapeno's can very widely in the heat they have. Add a little at a time and mix it in really good and taste test to your liking. I personally like just a little heat with this recipe so it doesn't over power the actual taste of the salsa.

I need some help in refining my lunch plan. In an effort to loose weight, this is my current meal plan: 

Breakfast - 3/4-1 cup red rice, and any amount of lentils and veggies - I like a full and savoury meal in the morning! 

Lunch - no carbs as they make me sleepy. So I have any 2 fruits (usually banana and apple but I try for variety), carrots capsicum, etc. Or maybe a salad. 

Dinner - 2 Roti / bread / other carb, any amount of veggies or protein

I find this works great energy-wise, but I need to add a *bit* more to my lunch to keep me going. I need ideas for what I could do. A sandwich etc would be doable later in the day (day 4 pm) but I would rather avoid carbs for lunch as I get enough for breakfast and dinner.

The smoked sausage definitely makes this less healthy than healthy, but you could do worse. You can sub turkey sausage if you’d like. I’ve used both, both are good. Regular smoked sausage has more flavor.

I used the instant pot and dinner was ready in 1 hour 15 mins. We had it for dinner and I took it for lunch two days in a row. Microwaves really well. I do drown mine in hot sauce and I’m super heavy handed with the pinto bean seasoning prior to cooking.

1lb bag dry pintos - $.99

12 oz ring of smoked sausage - $2.99 at Walmart

2 cups rice - $.25

Seasonings to taste (I use Fiesta brand Pinto Bean Seasoning, about 1/4 jar). Keep in mind it is really hard to OVER season beans but easy to UNDER season them. I normally add it to the point that I think it's enough and then add quite a bit more. But I also use a seasoning low in sodium. So take that into account. You can also google ""pinto bean seasoning"" and find some good ones. Just season liberally.

1 white onion - $.35

Add 6 cups water to IP, pour in dry beans, seasoning, diced onion, diced sausage. Set to high pressure for 45 minutes and let natural release for about 20 mins.

When it’s almost done cook the rice and mix rice with beans. I use Louisiana hot sauce on mine, but Chow Chow is also really good in it.

Here’s the seasoning I use (Rice not pictured):

https://imgur.com/a/eYlQJm8

If you don’t have an IP... soak the beans overnight. When ready discard soak water and replace with fresh. Enough water to cover the beans about an inch or so and bring all ingredients to a boil and turn down the heat and simmer for 1-2 hours. You’ll know it’s done when the beans are the right consistency.

I eat pretty well, but am a pasta junkie.

This week for dinners, I want to do a spicy no-meat alfredo/white/creamy type pasta, very simple.

I usually make this with cooked whole wheat pasta, Trader Joe's jar alfredo sauce, wilted fresh baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, and crushed red pepper all combined in a pan.

Just wondering, what can I do to make this as minor of a health offense as possible? I already use nothing but whole wheat pasta, no meat, no cheese (other than whatever is in the jarred sauce).  Would it be better to make my own sauce with milk/parm cheese or something? Or is it more or less ok as is?

This is the link to the alfredo sauce, really the only processed thing I use in this:

Then put them back in a pot with fresh water covering the radish (cuts down) and add all of the other ingredients.  Bring to boil and then lower heat to low simmer until they turn golden.

So I have a pretty bad case of [Oral Allergy Syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/oral-allergy-syndrome). This means that raw fruits, vegetables, and nuts will make my throat itch and swell, sometimes really badly. Cooked (VERY thoroughly), many of these foods are fine. However, I also unfortunately have a butt-ton of ""true"" allergies to things such as nuts, some fruits, and soy, amongst many other things, which I can't eat regardless of preparation.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/4ef4vr/i_have_oral_allergy_syndrome_no_raw_veggies/) from this sub touches on the difficulty of cooking with OAS, but where I struggle most is healthy snack foods. I can cook vegetables into things fine but being unable to eat nuts, fruits, and raw veggies REALLY limits my options for snacks and even breakfast. Also, lots of very raw/organic/whole grain options also trigger my oral allergy syndrome, so are ironically worse for me than more processed foods. :( This is also the same reason I have problems with things like rolled ""no-cook"" bars with oats/flax seeds/etc.

I would appreciate some pointers on some healthy snacks given my  very limited options-- every time I see snack posts on this sub most suggestions include nuts/fruit/veggies... Or something I can eat (rice cakes, for example) but would be unappealing without the toppings I can't eat (nut butters). I also have sleep disorders and it'd be nice to have some go-to pick-me-ups to keep my energy up during the day or even something to replace the quick healthy on-the-go breakfast options people have. The most I can think of so far is roasted chickpeas (which I do really like!) and popcorn, but it'd be nice to have more variety.

Lastly I'll add that I've moved into my first apartment and still have some move-in budget left so would be willing to drop some money on a nice cooking appliance that might help me prepare foods I can't normally eat because of my OAS.

The most I can think of so far is roasted chickpeas (which I do really like!) and popcorn, but it&amp;#39;d be nice to have more variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I&amp;#39;ll add that I&amp;#39;ve moved into my first apartment and still have some move-in budget left so would be willing to drop some money on a nice cooking appliance that might help me prepare foods I can&amp;#39;t normally eat because of my OAS.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope that my post doesn't come off as negative or counter to the intentions of the sub, but I've noticed a trend in much of the advice and recipes/tips that are posted here. Generally speaking, people will do things that will essentially weaken the nutritional value of their foods to simply save a few dollars.

For example, I've seen this idea of blending mushrooms and mixing it with ground beef to make it last longer. This, to me, is absurd. If you'd like to eat smaller portions of hamburger and add mushroom to make it more satiating (but with fewer calories) then go for it. However, acting like 1 lb of lean ground beef is the same as .5 lb with some mushrooms mixed in is simply wrong. These two foods have vastly different values to your body. Would you water down milk and tell all of your friends about a neat trick you've learned to cut your dairy costs in half?

Another I saw recently was suggesting to mix oatmeal with dried fruit (which is quite expensive where I live at least and is essentially just stale carbs that have been dehydrated with sugar) and add powdered pudding mix to it. I'm sorry, I just don't see this as cheap OR ""healthy"". You're eating a bunch of simple and complex carbs, which might be useful in certain situations but pretty much nothing else. This is literally junk food, and not even very frugally minded.

I'm not sure if people have a firm grasp on the basics of nutrition and instead just kind of hold some vague notion of what ""healthy"" eating means to them based on what they've read in articles or have been told as they've matured.

As I've grown older, I've actually learned to view what I eat as a financial priority. This doesn't mean that I frivolously spend on pre-made foods following the latest dietary trends or go out to eat every evening. It simply means that I justify spending a little more on foods that align with my nutritional goals and that facilitate my lifestyle.

Again, I don't mean to belittle anyone and refrained from using too many examples because I don't want anyone to feel attacked. Would love to hear this community's thoughts!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

* 1 box of mini tomatoes
* 2 cups of corn
* 2 cups of peas
* 6 tablespoons of olive oil.
* Salt
* Peper

**Preparation**

In a saucepan with salted water, boil chicken fillets. Once cooked well, remove them and, after they cool down, cut them into small pieces. In a large pan heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil and sauté onions and garlic on medium heat. The process is done until they are golden. Then add the small tomatoes, lower the heat and let them boil for 15 minutes until they soften without melting. Stir at regular intervals.

**Other Materials**

Then add the chicken, corn, peas, pepper and if necessary, just a little more salt and continue shaking. Once the corn and peas are softened, remove the mixture from the fire. Add the cheese and let it cool down. Open the 2 rolls of puff pastry with the rolling pin, then sprinkle with a little flour in a rectangular shape. Pour a square pan with the remaining oil and then spread one sheet of puff pastry. Lay the filling over and finish by placing the second sheet over the filling. We bind the two leaves with our fingers to close the filling.
**Baking**
Bake the chicken pie in a preheated oven for 35 minutes until the dough is golden.

Apologies if this has been posted before, I tried searching for a post already but couldn't find something that applied exactly to my situation. If there is a thread, just link me and I'll delete this!

So I am a young college student, I live with my dad and I get $40 every week for food. For about the past 3 years I have almost strictly lived off of fast food, going to Taco Bell 3 times a week isn't an abnormal thing for me. I have been realizing lately that if I don't change how I eat I'm going to regret it a lot, I mean there's no hiding my unhealthy lifestyle. I don't exercise, I eat nothing but fast food, (at least I don't drink pop?) Recently, Ive decided it's time to change my lifestyle starting with my diet.

Here's my problem: I hate fast food. I literally do not crave fast food what so ever, and I've been trying to cook and meal prep. I don't really have time to cook throughout the week, so I usually try to do meal prep on the weekends. But I feel like I NEED to eat fast food if I want to be full? If that makes sense. Like I will meal prep 1 dish, I have tons of healthy snacks and things, and I eat all these things. I love how home cooking taste, but I always feel like if I want to be full / ""get my calories in"" for the day, I need fast food. 

What do I need to do to not have the need to leave my house for food? People always tell me lots of veggies, rice, beans, chicken, but how do you put those things together? I look up lots of recipes and make tasty stuff, but I still feel the urge and need to get fast food. How do I get in the habit of making food and only eating food I make? 

Any insight is appreciated, thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

**Breakfast Burrito**

Breakfast: Sunday – Saturday

For 7 meals:

* 12 eggs
* 3 potatoes
* 1 lb. sausage / 500g
* 14 tortillas

Breakfast burritos are my favorite! You may recall a similar recipe I used before with only eggs and potatoes, this one is a more hearty version.

Scramble the eggs in a pan, and also cook the sausage thoroughly in a pan (breaking into small pieces). Shred the potatoes (using a cheese grater works perfectly) and cooking over high heat until they are golden and crisp. I like to cook my potatoes like pancakes, this makes the outside crispy but the inside soft.

When everything is finished cooking, fill each tortilla with some of everything, roll it up, and store it in the freezer. You can store it in plastic wrap, aluminum foil or just a regular Ziploc bag.

Each morning, pop 2 in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes and enjoy.

\*Note: Cool down your ingredients before constructing your burritos, this will prevent it from becoming soggy when you reheat.

**Caribbean Rice and Beans with Meat**

Lunch: Sunday – Wednesday

For 4 meals:

* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 onion
* 2 tsp. creole spice (or cajun seasoning) / 12ml
* 2 cups uncooked rice / 4.7dl
* 13.5 oz. can coconut milk / 380g
* 15.5 oz. can kidney beans / 440g
* 2 1/4 cups chicken broth / 5.3dl
* 3 chicken breasts (or meat of your choice)

As a heads up, you can make chicken broth with water 2 and chicken bouillon cubes if that’s more convenient for you.

First, wash your rice until the water runs clear and then drain.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add some oil or butter, then add diced onions and garlic. Sauté for about a minute. Stir in the rice, followed by the kidney beans, and keeping stirring around for about 2 minutes. Then add coconut milk, chicken broth, creole spice, and bring this to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and lit it simmer with a lid on top.

Let this cook for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is cooked, and stir occasionally to prevent the sides/bottom from burning.

While this is cooking, you can prepare the chicken breasts. Because the rice and bean dish is so tasty on its own, just cooking the chicken with salt and pepper is plenty. Chop the chicken into strips and then divvy it up into 4 days of meals with the Caribbean rice and beans.

**Honduran Baleadas (Street Tacos)**

Lunch: Thursday – Saturday

For 3 meals:

* 6 large tortillas
* 4 cups refried beans / 9.5dl
* 3 cups cheese / 7dl
* 1 cup sour cream (or a salsa) / 2.4dl
* 2 small tomatoes

Spread warmed-up refried beans evenly over a warm tortilla. Sprinkle cheese and drizzle sour cream. Top with sliced tomatoes and any other toppings. Fold in half like a taco! Eat 2 for each meal.

I think if you sprinkled some of the previous creole seasoning it would be very tasty, too! I haven’t tried doing that, so I’m not sure, but it sounds good.

**Jamaican Jerk Chicken Chili**

Dinner: Sunday – Wednesday

For 4 meals:

* 1 lb. boneless chicken / 500g
* 1 bunch green onion
* 1 onion
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 spicy pepper (jalepeno, habanero, etc.)
* 15.5 oz. kidney beans / 440g
* 15.5 oz. black beans / 440g
* 15.5 oz. canned crushed tomatoes / 440g
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 cup Jamaican jerk marinade / 2.4dl

These aren’t necessary, but it would make it taste out of this world, add: 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 2 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. allspice, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

You can either cook this in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours, low for 6-8 hours, or in a large pot on the stove for about 1.5 hours on a simmer.

Basically, just dump everything into the pot and let it cook. Stir it around a few times, and add salt and pepper to your liking. You can eat this as-is, with crackers, avocado or rice… whatever you feel like!

If you end up making more than 4 portions, you can freeze the rest and save for when you’re rushed for time.

**Ropa Vieja (Cuban Beef Stew)**

Dinner: Thursday – Saturday

For 3 meals:

* 1 lb. beef stew meat (1-inch cubes) / 500g
* 2 bell peppers
* 5 garlic cloves
* 30 oz. cans crushed tomatoes / 850g
* 1.5 cups cooked rice / 3.5dl

Again, not necessary, but you can also add: 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/2 tsp. paprika.

This can also be done the slow cooker route or on the stove with the same guidelines as before.

Before you dump everything in a large pot, you’ll want to sear your beef and bell peppers. Do this by heating oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef and allow all outer edges to brown. Do not worry about the meat being cooked or not. Once done, transfer to a big pot or slow cooker.

Sear bell peppers strips in the pan, cooking just until they soften slightly.

Add the bell peppers and all remaining ingredients into a pot. Let this cook until the beef is tender and you can shred it using 2 forks. Mix it all together and serve with cooked rice.

**Bliss Bars**

Snacks: Sunday – Saturday

For 7 snacks:

* 1 cup almonds / 2.4dl
* 2 cups dates / 4.7dl
* 1 1/2 cup coconut flakes / 3.5dl
* 1/3 cup cocoa powder / 80ml
* water as needed

If using whole almonds, you will need to blend them or put them in a processor to break them down. If you are using sliced or slivered almonds, you can skip this step.

In a blender or processor, add all your ingredients (except water) and blend until they create a texture that’s smooth and clumps together. You may need to add a tablespoon (18ml) of water at a time to achieve this, depending on how much moisture your dates contain.

Line a 8×8 baking pan with parchment paper and press the mixture into the pan. Flatten and smooth the mixture, then pop in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.

After that, you can slice them into bars and store in the fridge for up to 1 week (or in the freezer if you want to store them longer).

&lt;p&gt;While this is cooking, you can prepare the chicken breasts. Because the rice and bean dish is so tasty on its own, just cooking the chicken with salt and pepper is plenty. Chop the chicken into strips and then divvy it up into 4 days of meals with the Caribbean rice and beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honduran Baleadas (Street Tacos)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch: Thursday – Saturday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 3 meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 large tortillas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 cups refried beans / 9.5dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 cups cheese / 7dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup sour cream (or a salsa) / 2.4dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 small tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spread warmed-up refried beans evenly over a warm tortilla. Sprinkle cheese and drizzle sour cream. Top with sliced tomatoes and any other toppings. Fold in half like a taco! Eat 2 for each meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if you sprinkled some of the previous creole seasoning it would be very tasty, too! I haven’t tried doing that, so I’m not sure, but it sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamaican Jerk Chicken Chili&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner: Sunday – Wednesday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 4 meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 lb. boneless chicken / 500g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bunch green onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bell pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 spicy pepper (jalepeno, habanero, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15.5 oz. kidney beans / 440g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15.5 oz. black beans / 440g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15.5 oz. canned crushed tomatoes / 440g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 cloves garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup Jamaican jerk marinade / 2.4dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t necessary, but it would make it taste out of this world, add: 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 2 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. allspice, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either cook this in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours, low for 6-8 hours, or in a large pot on the stove for about 1.5 hours on a simmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, just dump everything into the pot and let it cook. Stir it around a few times, and add salt and pepper to your liking. You can eat this as-is, with crackers, avocado or rice… whatever you feel like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you end up making more than 4 portions, you can freeze the rest and save for when you’re rushed for time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ropa Vieja (Cuban Beef Stew)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner: Thursday – Saturday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 3 meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 lb. beef stew meat (1-inch cubes) / 500g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bell peppers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 garlic cloves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 oz. cans crushed tomatoes / 850g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 cups cooked rice / 3.5dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, not necessary, but you can also add: 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/2 tsp. paprika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also be done the slow cooker route or on the stove with the same guidelines as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you dump everything in a large pot, you’ll want to sear your beef and bell peppers. Do this by heating oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef and allow all outer edges to brown. Do not worry about the meat being cooked or not. Once done, transfer to a big pot or slow cooker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sear bell peppers strips in the pan, cooking just until they soften slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the bell peppers and all remaining ingredients into a pot. Let this cook until the beef is tender and you can shred it using 2 forks. Mix it all together and serve with cooked rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bliss Bars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snacks: Sunday – Saturday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 7 snacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup almonds / 2.4dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cups dates / 4.7dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cup coconut flakes / 3.5dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup cocoa powder / 80ml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If using whole almonds, you will need to blend them or put them in a processor to break them down. If you are using sliced or slivered almonds, you can skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a blender or processor, add all your ingredients (except water) and blend until they create a texture that’s smooth and clumps together. You may need to add a tablespoon (18ml) of water at a time to achieve this, depending on how much moisture your dates contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line a 8×8 baking pan with parchment paper and press the mixture into the pan. Flatten and smooth the mixture, then pop in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, you can slice them into bars and store in the fridge for up to 1 week (or in the freezer if you want to store them longer).&lt;/p&gt;

Mix the pudding powder with the oats really well and then add the liquids, otherwise you're going to be stirring pudding into oats. 

It's also worth mentioning that using dried fruit is what they do in those little oatmeal packets you had as a kid, and it's a great way to add fruit - the dried fruit has concentrated flavors that pop, but the process of soaking overnight partially rehydrates the fruit, so it kind of bursts into your mouth, especially the cherries.  For the Banana, however, keep in mind how long bananas last in the fridge - you may want to halve the recipe so it's not going to be sitting there for a few days.  


**Base:**

* 4 cups oats mixed with Pudding mix of choice
* 2 cups milk mixed with 2 cups water
* Chia and or flax seeds
* Add Ins 


***My favorite combos:***

**Banana Bread** *(seriously tastes just like Banana Bread)*

   * Sugar-free banana pudding mix
   * Cinnamon
   * Dehydrated bananas


**Apple Pie**

   * Sugar-free vanilla pudding mix
   * Cinnamon and pie spice
   * Dehydrated apples


**White Chocolate Cherry**

   * Sugar-free white chocolate pudding mix
   * Chocolate chips (I use sugar free) 
   * Dehydrated cherries


You can use any combination of pudding and fruit you want! This makes a big batch that is probably a week's worth of oatmeal, I keep it in my fridge and either scoop some out into a bowl or sometimes just eat it by the spoonful when I'm hangry. You can probably easily portion this into smaller containers and freeze it but I'm not sure how that would turn out.

As for the Chia and or flax seeds, I usually add both, you can do either or none of them. Flax seeds tend to get a little slimy like an egg white but it's easily mix back into the mix, it's worth it for the nutrition value and it's tasteless. I like chia seeds because they add a nutty flavor.

We just moved a couple months ago and are still settling in. My husband works full time, and I just started going back to school full time as well.

I'm the main cook in the house, and I'm sort of out of ideas for what to do. My husband has a pretty sensitive digestive system and I'm at a loss. 

Too much salt makes him feel really gross, so that's a pretty easy adjustment. We're both trying to eat less red meat which gives him heartburn, but he's not a huge leftover chicken fan. We still need protein, but beans give him stomach aches. So I thought soups and egg bakes like crustless quiches, but soup isn't filling enough for his workdays and the texture of reheated egg wigs him out. He's allergic to fruit-it makes his throat swell. I grew up eating a veg rich diet, so I'm trying to implement that, but tomatoes give him heartburn as well as eggplant. Isn't into peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, avocado, cauliflower, or carrots. We're trying to eat less simple carbs too, but pasta is like my only option anymore. 

Right now I makes what feels like the same 5 dishes: arroz caldo, jambalaya, ragu alla bolognese (but only once a week because red meat and tomatoes), baked chicken thighs with roasted asparagus or broccoli, pasta with a garlic and olive oil based sauce and lots of kale, and *sometimes* chili (because again, beans and tomatoes). We mostly get our veggies from steam bags, which are great, but flavor. I miss flavor. 

For a bit I thought I found a work around with mushrooms but I guess I made mushroom based things so often he's kind of sick of it. I could eat mushrooms every day for the rest of forever, but that's a story for another day. 

I'm dying for some variety. But since we're on a budget I can't be making separate meals for me. I'm the more flexible one so I just have to make something we'll both eat. Today I suggested an herbed zucchini pasta bake (trying to replace a bit of the pasta volume with veg) and it was nixed for the zucchini. I'm ready to throw in the towel.

Recipe isn't overly specific on purpose because you can change stuff around as you please. 

There's a lot of openness for modification here which I'll be doing since I am an ex chef but the basics are as follows:

Risotto rice
Sage (preferably fresh but dried works fine)
Butternut squash (only need half for two people)
50-100ml of White wine (fruity preferably) 
Butter (75-100g)
Veggie stock (1 litre overall, 4 oxo cubes)
Small amount of oil

This is the base recipe only. I'll list some changes I made for ideas underneath.

1. Start by putting the risotto on the hob because it takes the longest. Add some sage here to the dry rice and add 500ml of veggie stock (from 2 oxo cubes) at a time to the risotto and boil on a low heat to avoid sticking to the pan. What you are aiming for here is to reduce the liquid to below the rice level and then top it back up again with another 500ml plus a small amount of white wine. Temperature control is important, too low and you won't reduce the stock, too high your rice will stick to the base of the pan and burn. Make sure to stir regularly. 

2. Prepare the butternut squash. This is done by cutting it in half and removing the seeds with a spoon then use a peeler to remove the skin which is pretty tough. Chop half of the squash into cubes small enough to swallow and place on a baking tray with a small amount of oil over the top to prevent sticking. These are done when they start to brown a little on top. I used 200 degrees for around 20 minutes on a gas oven. Since I was keeping an eye on the risotto anyway I didn't leave the room for more than a minute.

3. When the second 500ml veggie stock has reduced then add the butter and stir till melted.

4. Serve with risotto on bottom with the squash in the middle on top. Add fresh sage here again if you wish for style points but it can be a little overpowering if you use too much. I used dried sage in the stock and it was more than enough.

Optional stuff here -
Works with chicken stock and chicken just as well as with veggie stock. As much as I love meat though, it felt like cheating with this since meat adds flavour to everything and it's more challenging to concentrate good flavours without it.

I added spinach and a tin of chick peas (liquid drained) during stage 3 of the above points for added colour and flavour. Kidney beans would be great too. 

You can also add tinned chopped tomatoes to the broth in exchange for some veggie stock.

Cheese can be added on top at the end, I used grated cheddar.

Chopped celery can add a bit more crunch to the broth if you prefer. Carrots also work but it tends to look too orange with the squash so if you are going for style points, give this one a miss. 

You can concentrate more flavour in the broth by adding a bouquet garni and a bay leaf whilst reducing. All those lovely flavours really sink into the risotto.

For those of you that like heat, adding chilli's to the broth works great too but try avoid using sauces because it detracts from all that flavour you pushed into the risotto.

For a more Asian style dish, add garlic to the broth and some soy sauce. When the dish is cooked sprinkle some sesame seeds, spring onion and sesame oil over the top.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figured I should share this recipe since it&amp;#39;s something I made literally two days ago and it&amp;#39;s in season with autumn veggies coming in.

I've made so many different variations of this chicken dinner. You basically have a blank slate in terms of broth, but I usually keep it simple: aromatics, stock, tomatoes (canned or fresh), and then an herb at the end – basil or parsley are usually my go-to, but you can do a more Asian, Mexican, or Indian inspired broth (use ginger or cumin/chili powder or mustard seeds in the broth and finish with cilantro or scallions or sesame oil). You can serve this with rice, bread, or potatoes!

It's ridiculously easy to prepare and, in my opinion, makes for a beautifully plated dish!

Here's my simple recipe for Roast Chicken Legs in Tomato-Basil Broth (I used African basil because they had it at the farmer's market and I wanted to try it!)

Recipe here originally: [Roast Chicken Legs in Tomato-Basil Broth](https://triedtrue.us/ChickenTomatoBasil)

## Grade

Serves: 4, as a light dinner

Cost: About $3.28 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 50-55 minutes (35-40 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients for Roast Chicken Legs in Tomato-Basil Broth

4 chicken leg quarters

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced

1 red Fresno chili pepper (or 1 jalapeño), trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds

3 cups chicken stock

1 teaspoon paprika

Salt and pepper to taste

Crushed red pepper to taste

1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved

Fresh basil leaves, to taste (We used about 1/3 cup of African basil leaves but you can use 10-12 Italian basil leaves, torn)

**For Serving:**

Toasted baguette slices

## Method

## Prepare the Chicken:

Preheat oven to 400ºF. In a wide sauté pan or braising pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium-high heat until very hot.

Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the hot pan, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5-6 minutes or until the skin is crispy and golden brown. Flip the legs and cook 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. *You may need to cook in batches, depending on how large your legs are.*

## Cook the Aromatics:

Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of chicken fat in the pan. Return the pan to medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 5 minutes or until it begins to soften.

Add the garlic and sliced hot pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic.

Pour the chicken broth into the pan and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of pan. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the paprika and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat.

## Finish the Roast Chicken:

Nestle the chicken legs into the broth and transfer to the oven. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF.

Remove from the oven and carefully stir the basil leaves into the broth.

## To Serve:

Spoon the tomato-basil broth into bowls and place a chicken leg on each bowl. Serve with toasted bread. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/yZG8aDT.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/yZG8aDT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 red Fresno chili pepper (or 1 jalapeño), trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 cups chicken stock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon paprika&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt and pepper to taste&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crushed red pepper to taste&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh basil leaves, to taste (We used about 1/3 cup of African basil leaves but you can use 10-12 Italian basil leaves, torn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Serving:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toasted baguette slices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prepare the Chicken:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 400ºF. In a wide sauté pan or braising pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium-high heat until very hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the hot pan, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5-6 minutes or until the skin is crispy and golden brown. Flip the legs and cook 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. &lt;em&gt;You may need to cook in batches, depending on how large your legs are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cook the Aromatics:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of chicken fat in the pan. Return the pan to medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 5 minutes or until it begins to soften.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the garlic and sliced hot pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour the chicken broth into the pan and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of pan. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the paprika and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finish the Roast Chicken:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle the chicken legs into the broth and transfer to the oven. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove from the oven and carefully stir the basil leaves into the broth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To Serve:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoon the tomato-basil broth into bowls and place a chicken leg on each bowl. Serve with toasted bread. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

If you use non-canned meat, you can probably add a bit of salt, too, but mine turned out fine without it. Amounts were eyeballed save for the vegetables and chicken.

* The bag of veggies was probably ≤$3, the soy sauce was I don't remember, the chili sauce was ~$2 after tax, and the can of chicken was ~$3 after tax, though things like the pepper, soy sauce, and chilli sauce you will get more than one use out of.

* I added some olive oil to the pan and let it heat up. Eye on high, but you know how different stovetop temps can be. After it was heated, I dumped the entire bag of frozen veggies in and cooked them until they were mostly thawed, at least visibly. I then added the soy sauce and some chili sauce, stirred and let cook for a bit more, and then added the meat and more sauces. I also added the black pepper. I stirred it until I was satisfied the sauce was spread throughout the ingredients sufficiently, and then afterward regularly to prevent sticking/burning. After I thought it was cooked enough I turned the eye off and let it cool a little before eating. It was really spicy, but really good!

* one can of vegetarian refried beans
* one cup of frozen beyond meat crumbles
* if you’re feeling wild, you can make one with only daiya cheese or mix the cheese in with the meat crumbles and beans. totally up to you.

start by heating a pan and placing some veggie oil in it. enough to coat some diced up onions in. let the onions carmalize and sizzle for a couple of minutes. place the refried beans in the mix and warm up until runny. heat up the frozen beyond meat crumbles in the microwave or stove – your preference. stir the warmed up meat crumbles into the onion and bean mix. let sit while you start making the masa.

take three cups of masa and place it in a bowl with four cups of water. mix it with your hands until it resembles cookie batter. (doing some foreshadowing here: cookie recipe coming soon!)

once the masa looks like cookie batter, start to make tortilla-like shapes. ball up the dough, pat it down in your palms and lay out. take the warmed up bean/onion/beyond meat mix and place little spoonfuls on each patted down tortilla. place a tortilla on top to seal it up. pinch the edges together so all the yummy goodies are encapsulated in this warm pocket of deliciousness you’ve created, you master chef you.

in a separate pan, warm up 1/4 cup of veggie oil. allow it to get hot. place your pupusas in the pan. allow each side to cook for about five minutes. serve with a side of herdez guacamole sauce, if you’re into that kind of thing.

Ingredients

* 3 medium-to-large sweet potatoes
* 3 T butter
* 1/4 C sugar
* 2 t cinnamon
* 1/2 t nutmeg
* 4 eggs

Method

1. Cook the sweet potatoes until there is no resistance when pierced with a fork. The texture of the casserole will be sub par if it's even a little bit hard. I've heard it referred to as ""cooked into submission."" It was about 11 minutes on high in a covered dish in the microwave for me, rotating the potatoes every few minutes.
2. Peel and mash the cooked sweet potatoes in a large casserole dish.
3. Add remaining ingredients; stir thoroughly to combine.
4. Cook until a toothpick inserted into the mixture comes out clean (I used the microwave and stirred it every few minutes to make it cook faster)
5. Top with fruit (blueberries is one I like), marshmallows, or dark chocolate. The chocolate was my favorite but obviously the blueberries were the healthiest topping. If you want them warm or melted, cover the dish for a few minutes after topping it.

You can vary the amount of eggs; the original recipe called for 1 egg, but I found that it tasted pretty much the same with more eggs and I needed the extra protein for a picky eater.

This is not as sweet as commercial desserts. If you are expecting a lot of sugar, you'll need at least 1/3 - 1/2 C sugar.

Apples could be another great topping.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweet Potato Casserole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 medium-to-large sweet potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 T butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 C sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 t cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 t nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook the sweet potatoes until there is no resistance when pierced with a fork. The texture of the casserole will be sub par if it&amp;#39;s even a little bit hard. I&amp;#39;ve heard it referred to as &amp;quot;cooked into submission.&amp;quot; It was about 11 minutes on high in a covered dish in the microwave for me, rotating the potatoes every few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peel and mash the cooked sweet potatoes in a large casserole dish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add remaining ingredients; stir thoroughly to combine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook until a toothpick inserted into the mixture comes out clean (I used the microwave and stirred it every few minutes to make it cook faster)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top with fruit (blueberries is one I like), marshmallows, or dark chocolate. The chocolate was my favorite but obviously the blueberries were the healthiest topping. If you want them warm or melted, cover the dish for a few minutes after topping it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can vary the amount of eggs; the original recipe called for 1 egg, but I found that it tasted pretty much the same with more eggs and I needed the extra protein for a picky eater.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Half a 500g bag of Frozen Mixed Peppers (counts as 3 of your 5 a day (as you have 80g of each colour of bell pepper -  and different colours have different nutrition)) - £0.50 (Tesco).
2. Tin of sardines in tomato concentrate (if it contains 20g of tomato concentrate (my 125g tin does) then its 1 of your 5 a day! £0.36 (LIDL/ALDI)

How to cook:

1. Pour a tiny amount of oil into pan and heat. Add the frozen mixed peppers and sardines. Cook for 6 minutes for the peppers to be ready. 

Optional extras:

1. I also add 1 teaspoon of nutritional yeast at the end. It contains ALL your B vitamins for the day except B12 - and the sardines have all your B12. Cost £0.11 (Amazon). 

2. I sprinkle in chili flakes, himalayan salt, No-Salt (potassium) for taste and minerals. Also a little paprika for more vitamin A (beta carotene will make your skin radient). 

3. You can instead buy sardines in olive oil and pour some of that oil in the pan at the start. And add 20g tomato concentrate from a tube. 

4. You could also add 80g frozen diced onions at the start. You are now at 5 of your 5 a day. £0.20

5. Add sardines right at the end instead of the start to preserve more omega 3; though you are not going to lose much.

This meal/snack:

* costs less than £1
* is ~300 calories
* takes 6 minutes
* is hot and delicious and colourful
* all ingredients can be bought in bulk and stored in the cupboard/freezer. No throwing away food you forget to use.
* no food waste / chopping
* if you add the nutritional yeast (and MAYBE 1 tsp paprika, though might be enough red pepper for vitamin A already) then you have 100% your vitamin A, 100% of every vitamin B, 100% your vitamin C, 100% your vitamin D (depends on sardine brand?) (according to FDA but their numbers are arguably too low so get some sunlight still). You just need vitamin E (sunflower oil) and vitamin K (leafy greens). 
* Uses the most dense (and cheap) omega 3 food available. You should aim for an omega 3 omega 6 ratio of 1:1 (most westerners have 15:1 and need more omega 3). And sardines are more omega 3 dense than beef is omega 6 dense. These 100g of sardines will offset 400g-500g of beef ! see: https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/bwgm5l/a_100g_tin_of_sardines_has_enough_omega_3_to/

Recipe here originally: [Chicken Meatball Soup with Rice](https://triedtrue.us/ChickenMeatballsRice)

I love this chicken meatball soup with rice recipe! It's really easy to prepare. I used parmesan cheese because I had some in my fridge about to go bad, but you can omit it! You can also cook the chicken meatballs right in the soup instead of pan-frying and baking and it will be just as good!

**Omissions and substitutions are noted below!**

You can also add a little butter to the skillet after the mushrooms have browned if you want something a bit richer.

Use 1 onion and split it in half, using half in the meatballs and half in the soup.

### Grade

Serves: 4-5

Cost: About $5.39 per serving, if using parmesan cheese ($4.32 per serving if omitting the parmesan cheese)

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes

### Ingredients for Chicken Meatball Soup with Rice

**Chicken Meatballs**

3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

1/2 yellow onion, peeled and minced

1 cayenne pepper or red Fresno chili pepper, trimmed and minced

1 pound ground chicken

1/2 cup parmesan cheese **(can be omitted)**

1 egg

1/4 cup heavy cream **(or use milk)**

1/2 cup breadcrumbs, plus more as necessary

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil, for frying

**Soup**

1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil, if needed

1/2 yellow onion, peeled and diced

2 small leeks, trimmed, scrubbed, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced cross-wise into half-moons

8 ounces white button mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced

2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

4 carrots, peeled and small-diced

4 cups chicken stock

1/2 cup rice (white or brown but brown will take longer to cook)

2 teaspoons lemon juice

1 teaspoon paprika

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

**For Serving:**

Freshly minced parsley, optional

### Method

###### Prepare the Chicken Meatballs:

Preheat oven to 350ºF. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients for the chicken meatballs except the neutral cooking oil and combine them with your hands, being careful not to over-mix the chicken.

Form the mixture into large tablespoon sized meatballs and set aside.

###### Cook the Meatballs:

In a wide, ovenproof sauté pan, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2-3 minutes on one side. Flip and transfer to the oven for 10 minutes or until the meatballs are mostly cooked through. Remove the pan from the oven and return it to the stove.

Transfer the meatballs to a bowl.

###### Cook the Soup Vegetables:

If the pot seems dry, add another teaspoon or two of neutral cooking oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and onions and cook for 3-4 minutes or until they just begin to soften.

Next, add the mushrooms and cook for 7-10 minutes or until they are well-browned.

After the mushrooms are well-browned, add the garlic and carrots and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Season all of the vegetables with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.

###### Finish the Soup:

Pour in the chicken stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Add the rice and meatballs and bring the broth to a boil. Season to taste with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper. Add 1 teaspoon paprika. Reduce heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender, the carrots are softened, and the meatballs are completely cooked through.

Add the lemon juice to the pot and turn off the heat.

###### To Serve:

Divide the soup between bowls and pile the meatballs on top. Garnish with freshly minced parsley if desired. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/uA1kdgH.jpg""&gt;Picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had digestive problems for a long time that are being kept mostly at bay by a daily probiotic and avoiding dairy. I also cannot eat oats because they make me nauseous for some reason. 

I tried smoothies for two weeks and was loving it for a little bit. First week I did different combos of frozen fruit (mixed berries, strawberries, and peaches), handful of spinach, almond milk, and peanut butter. I didn’t like the flavor of the peanut butter very much so I swapped that for a tablespoon of chia seeds the next week. After a few days, the smoothies were making me super bloated and I just felt nasty. I couldn’t handle it anymore so this week I decided to try something new. 

I prepped a dozen hard boiled eggs and decided to try two a morning with a small serving of applesauce. This feels... okay but still makes my stomach feel a little weird. I used to think that everyone felt a little sick after eating but now after taking probiotics and knows that it’s possible to feel “satisfied” or full but not sick, I don’t know if this will cut it. I’m gonna try it for a few more days but it would be nice to have another option. 

So what can I try next? Oats are out, I’ve tried to eat a banana but those also make me nauseous in the morning, could it be the sugar content of the fruit that’s causing me trouble?

First post here, August was my first month buying my own food (college student, woo..) I managed to keep it under $200 and definitely had a few things added in for fun that I don’t necessarily need. 

Going forward, I want to minimize this as much as possible. I’ll list what I’ve bought (that I plan on rebuying, definitely wasted some money pointlessly), where, and whether I’m hitting all my micros. Some background first, I’m currently bulking on about ~2700 calories a day, but I might have to raise it to 3k-ish depending on weight gain. So that’s my target daily intake, as well as making sure I hit 150g of protein.

These are my staples... some of it will carry me into this coming month (September) but the meat, dairy, and vegetables won’t. 
1. Chicken Breast (Raley’s)
2. Eggs (Costco)
3. Oats (Costco)
4. Rice (Costco)
5. Peanut Butter (Costco)
6. Milk (Costco)
7. Normandy Vegetables Blend (Costco)
8. Potatoes (Raley’s)
9. Spaghetti Noodles (Costco)
10. Prego Sauce (Costco)

These are my... eh I enjoy them foods but will probably cut back for cost sake
1. Redtop Greek Yogurt (cheapest variety)
2. Sugar-free Jell-o (my yogurt mix-in)
3. Giant Carton of Ice Cream
4. Chia Seeds (Overnight Oats!)
5. Cake Mix...
6. Tortillas

I have some spices/sauces already so won’t consider them as I’m pretty frugal with that stuff. 

This is my meal prepped food for this week.
Breakfast: Overnight Oats + PB
Lunch: Two Breakfast Burritos
Snack: Greek Yogurt
Dinner: Chicken with Potatoes and Vegetables
Dessert: Slice of cake and ice cream

I eat two servings of the vegetables daily, but is that enough to cover my micronutrient needs? That’s my big concern. I kind of see where I can cut back on cost (I won’t buy the cake mix again, for instance, and the rice/oats will lost me for a few months) in terms of items, but am I shopping at the right places? I’m pretty sure Costco is the best place for a lot of the stuff, but can I get meat cheaper? Thighs are too fatty for me so I am looking at Breasts or Thigh Fillets mainly. 

I guess this post is more of a am I kind of doing this right? And where can I improve? Any tips are appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

I managed to keep it under $200 and definitely had a few things added in for fun that I don’t necessarily need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I want to minimize this as much as possible. I’ll list what I’ve bought (that I plan on rebuying, definitely wasted some money pointlessly), where, and whether I’m hitting all my micros. Some background first, I’m currently bulking on about ~2700 calories a day, but I might have to raise it to 3k-ish depending on weight gain. So that’s my target daily intake, as well as making sure I hit 150g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my staples... some of it will carry me into this coming month (September) but the meat, dairy, and vegetables won’t. 
1. Chicken Breast (Raley’s)
2. Eggs (Costco)
3. Oats (Costco)
4. Rice (Costco)
5. Peanut Butter (Costco)
6. Milk (Costco)
7. Normandy Vegetables Blend (Costco)
8. Potatoes (Raley’s)
9. Spaghetti Noodles (Costco)
10. Prego Sauce (Costco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my... eh I enjoy them foods but will probably cut back for cost sake
1. Redtop Greek Yogurt (cheapest variety)
2. Sugar-free Jell-o (my yogurt mix-in)
3. Giant Carton of Ice Cream
4. Chia Seeds (Overnight Oats!)
5. Cake Mix...
6. Tortillas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some spices/sauces already so won’t consider them as I’m pretty frugal with that stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my meal prepped food for this week.
Breakfast: Overnight Oats + PB
Lunch: Two Breakfast Burritos
Snack: Greek Yogurt
Dinner: Chicken with Potatoes and Vegetables
Dessert: Slice of cake and ice cream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat two servings of the vegetables daily, but is that enough to cover my micronutrient needs? That’s my big concern. I kind of see where I can cut back on cost (I won’t buy the cake mix again, for instance, and the rice/oats will lost me for a few months) in terms of items, but am I shopping at the right places? I’m pretty sure Costco is the best place for a lot of the stuff, but can I get meat cheaper? Thighs are too fatty for me so I am looking at Breasts or Thigh Fillets mainly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this post is more of a am I kind of doing this right? And where can I improve? Any tips are appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been a severe procrastinator all my life and am really set on ease in order to make these changes last. Biggest challenge for me has always been eating properly so I really hope I can find the advice and help I need here!

My longterm goal is to be someone who cooks in bulk on Sundays and eats it throughout the week instead of gorging on processed food. I got a massive scare today regarding carcinogenic food and I realised I need to stop eating so much 'packaged' food like microwave meals, red highly-processed meat etc.

I'm thinking of making massive changes soon starting simple with preparing massive amounts of mashed potatoes and chicken and just living off doing that for awhile because ease over complexity is the push comes to shove type situation I feel myself in (being so historically bad at sticking to new ideas).

I can cook the basics what I like (mashed potatoes, rice, chicken, simple curries, breadcrumb chicken, broccoli/carrots and that's about it that doesn't include the carcinogenic red meats i'm canceling out my diet like burger patties, mince, bacon stuff).

Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im just moving into a very small space with a mini fridge, a microwave, a small amount of counter space, virtually no kitchen storage, and that&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;m really trying to make it as a halfway respectable adult despite not having a lot of traditional amenities. I see that there are plenty of recipes in this group already that will help out with this, but im looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations on what appliances are absolutely worth the space they take up vs. things that sound good but can easily be replaced by a multifunctioning alternative. I&amp;#39;m talking about toasters, toaster ovens, hot plates, rice makers, slow cookers, food processors, etc... I can&amp;#39;t fit all of these in my apartment! So i need to make good space saving decisions. (I have a decent budget set aside for this because it will help me have money down the line.)&lt;/p&gt;

Our braised chicken drumsticks with parmesan rice is a wonderful mid-week dinner option when you don’t feel like fussing over a lot of ingredients.

Best of all, it’s extremely versatile. You can swap out the vegetables as you like. We used zucchini, but you can use mushrooms or fresh green beans or cauliflower florets.

Serves: 4

Cost: $4.61 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

# Ingredients for Braised Chicken Drumsticks with Parmesan Rice

**Braised Chicken Drumsticks:**

8 drumsticks

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

2 cubanelle peppers or 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, deseeded, and diced

2 medium zucchini, trimmed and diced

1 teaspoon each: dry thyme, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder, plus more to taste

1 14.5-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes

1/2 cup vegetable stock

Salt and pepper to taste

**Parmesan Rice:**

2 cups dry wild or brown rice

3 and 1/2 cups water

1 tablespoon butter, optional

Salt, to taste

1/2 cup freshly chopped parsley, plus more for serving

1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

# Method

**Prepare the Rice:**

In a saucepan, combine the rice with the water, butter, and salt, and cook according to package instructions. If using wild rice, this will typically be bringing it to a boil, stirring, covering, and simmering for about 45 minutes. Allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes before fluffing. Keep warm.

**Brown the Chicken:**

As the rice cooks, prepare the chicken. Preheat oven to 425ºF.

Heat the neutral cooking oil in a wide braising pot over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Brown the chicken, in batches if needed, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

**Brown the Vegetables:**

If the pot seems too dry, add another drizzle of oil and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion and cubanelle pepper and cook for 5 minutes until beginning to soften.

Add the zucchini and season all over with thyme, crushed red pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook without moving for 3 minutes or until the zucchini begins to turn dark brown in places.

**Braise the Drumsticks:**

Pour in the vegetable stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Pour in the diced tomatoes and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences (more salt, pepper, thyme, crushed red pepper, or garlic powder to taste).

Nestle the drumsticks into the braising pot and transfer to the oven for 25-35 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reaches 165ºF. If desired, broil the chicken for 1-2 minutes to allow the skin to darken in color even more.

**Prepare the Parmesan Rice:**

Right before serving, stir the parmesan and parsley into the rice and toss to combine. Season to your preferences.

**To Serve:**

Divide the rice between bowls and spoon the broth and vegetables from the braising pan over top. Place two chicken drumsticks on top of each dish. Garnish with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

I'm generally not a fan of meal-prepping as there's only me to get through whatever I cook, and eating the same thing all week makes eating a chore instead of a delight.

Because I don't like making lots of dishes or eating the same thing over and over, I'm spending way too much on lunch out at work and convenience food at home. I need to turn that around.

I eat pretty healthy and enjoy lots of vegetables, fruit, and protein. I try to avoid too much starch as it's empty calories and can sits heavy on my stomach. The problem with produce and meat is that it's expensive. I'm not a big guy but eat fairly ample portions.

The grocery stores around me are quite expensive, too, although there's a Trader Joe's a mile away and a Costco about 20-30 minutes away. Cooking for one meal with one set of leftovers costs a lot and generates quite a bit of waste.

Does anyone have strategies or tactics to address the above (breaking out of the meal-planning doldrums and getting your veggies in)? ""Healthy"" means a lot of different things to different people, so I thought I'd be more specific here. Cheap and fast are also of the essence.

TLDR: PARTNER AND I ARE SICK FROM LACK ON NUTRITION, need help with new recipes to balance out a meat eater and pescatarian. 

I come to you all seeing r/eatcheapandheathly. Was told I had this in the wrong place. Please help. I’m new to cooking and being a wife. My partner and I have been very sick lately and I know we aren’t eating as balanced as we could be. We are both trying to be healthier but still end up buying just go to fillers that do nothing to help. Our diet consists of mostly frozen proteins (e.g. fish sticks, breaded shrimp, nuggets), rice, peppered with the occasional fruits and rotisserie chicken. If you lovely people could help me get us in order I would be eternally grateful. Please save me. 

Like I said I’m very new to cooking and I’m not great at meal planning. I feel if I could meal prep that would help but I don’t know what to cook that is filling and nutritious. I’m only really allergic to avocado. My partner leans more to being  pescatarian and low carb while I welcome all meats but would also like to be low carb. We are picky but hit me with anything I’m open.  We are in the USA and we spend about $50-$60 a week. If we could spend less that would help other areas but for now nutrition is most important. My partner has been sick for a week now. They’re always hungry now when before they ate like a bird and they have much stomach/bathroom related issues.

So, first off, love this sub when it shows up in my front page. I've gotten some good recipes from here in the past, including what's in my current meal list (which is very sparse). Anyway, though. I've got some pretty big major life issues going on right now that I don't need to get in to, but it is impacting my eating. Mostly it's hitting my drive to eat enough. I'm 30, male, and am sitting at 158lb last time I weighed myself like two days ago. About 2.5 weeks ago, I was 164-166 depending. There's a lot of stress, and I took up casual smoking, so that's not helping, but when I look at my eating I know I'm not getting anywhere near enough in my diet. So I'm looking for some help if possible.

As it is right now, my breakfast is pretty much always the same thing. I have two eggs in a frame (eggs basically sunny side up inside of bread that has a hole cut out of the inside for the egg to cook in) with some salt and pepper on them, and then three strips of bacon. I sometimes will add peanut butter on top of the eggs in a frame. Then my other meal, because I almost always only eat twice in the day, will consist of a burger (with some mustards, sometimes cheese. No bread) I've made myself ahead of time with a helping of steamed broccoli or cauliflower, or this fantastic meal I found on here which is chipotle black beans and cilantro lime rice that I'll put chicken in to. After I finish my current frozen stock of beef, I'll be mostly just having the bean, rice, and chicken dish. There will be days where, if I don't have work, I'll maybe eat a PB&amp;J at some point. Sometimes at work I'll have a trail bar of some sort, or some cashews. But that's about it

I know I need more of a lot of stuff. I need more calories in general, because I'm not getting anywhere near my TDEE. I know I need more veggies in my diet. I'm sure I need more of other stuff, too. One thing I'm solid with is getting enough water, so at least there's that. My issues is that I'm finding it hard to want to do more with my food. I do really enjoy the meals I'm having, despite it being the same thing all the time. Ideally, I would like things I could add to these meals that would help me out. I don't have a desk job, so eating at work is a little tough unless I'm on my break, which is when I'll eat my second meal. There is a fridge that I am able to store my food in, but I can't really duck back there to eat whenever, so anything I bring to work needs to be small and non perishable.

So I'm not necessarily looking for full on new recipes, but maybe just some suggestions for my current (super small) meal plan? I won't shy away from suggestions for other meals, but things that are simple are appreciated. I have a decently stocked kitchen (pressure cooker, instant pot, tabletop t-fal grill) in terms of cooking gear, but the simpler the better. I know one of the easiest ways to get more calories is going to be to eat more during the day, so even if it's suggestions of what to do for that, I'm all for it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first off, love this sub when it shows up in my front page. I&amp;#39;ve gotten some good recipes from here in the past, including what&amp;#39;s in my current meal list (which is very sparse). Anyway, though. I&amp;#39;ve got some pretty big major life issues going on right now that I don&amp;#39;t need to get in to, but it is impacting my eating. Mostly it&amp;#39;s hitting my drive to eat enough. I&amp;#39;m 30, male, and am sitting at 158lb last time I weighed myself like two days ago. About 2.5 weeks ago, I was 164-166 depending. There&amp;#39;s a lot of stress, and I took up casual smoking, so that&amp;#39;s not helping, but when I look at my eating I know I&amp;#39;m not getting anywhere near enough in my diet. So I&amp;#39;m looking for some help if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is right now, my breakfast is pretty much always the same thing. I have two eggs in a frame (eggs basically sunny side up inside of bread that has a hole cut out of the inside for the egg to cook in) with some salt and pepper on them, and then three strips of bacon. I sometimes will add peanut butter on top of the eggs in a frame. Then my other meal, because I almost always only eat twice in the day, will consist of a burger (with some mustards, sometimes cheese. No bread) I&amp;#39;ve made myself ahead of time with a helping of steamed broccoli or cauliflower, or this fantastic meal I found on here which is chipotle black beans and cilantro lime rice that I&amp;#39;ll put chicken in to. After I finish my current frozen stock of beef, I&amp;#39;ll be mostly just having the bean, rice, and chicken dish. There will be days where, if I don&amp;#39;t have work, I&amp;#39;ll maybe eat a PB&amp;amp;J at some point. Sometimes at work I&amp;#39;ll have a trail bar of some sort, or some cashews. But that&amp;#39;s about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I need more of a lot of stuff. I need more calories in general, because I&amp;#39;m not getting anywhere near my TDEE. I know I need more veggies in my diet. I&amp;#39;m sure I need more of other stuff, too. One thing I&amp;#39;m solid with is getting enough water, so at least there&amp;#39;s that.

Very fast and loose because I just kind of throw these things together. Don't have a price breakdown, but typically these are the meals that seem to last the longest for me, so I think they're not too bad cost-wise. These are cheap and easy from the perspective of a single person, by the way--I'm not sure if these might be more annoying to make with multiple people in mind.

1. Pork cutlets with mushroom and spinach creamy topping

This one just needs some pork cutlets (really cheap and on sale a lot for me), canned white mushrooms, spinach, chicken stock, and a teensy bit of flour (if you put too much it'll be REALLY thick which is still good but, up to you).

Season pork cutlets with salt and pepper (or whatever, honestly), put it on a plate. Then cook the canned mushrooms and spinach together in the juices, with garlic if you have it and garlic powder if you don't. Once they look mostly cooked, toss in the chicken stock and the flour and mix as well as you can until it reaches a good consistency.

I like to pair this with a baked potato for a really fancy feeling meal. Honestly, the texture of the mushrooms is great; hard to tell they're canned, at least like this. These heat up really well, so I usually make a huge batch and store the pork and topping separately. I want to say this one makes 4-5 servings for me.

2. Shrimp quesadillas

Prefacing this with I ALWAYS buy these guys on sale. It's like $10 for a lb and a half of shrimp, and I usually eat 4-5 shrimp for a serving. Lasts me about two weeks, maybe a little more! Good for some cheap luxury. This one's shrimp, canned rotel chile and tomato, canned refried beans, mexican cheese, and a tortilla.

Fry the shrimp with some onion and garlic powder, place the tortilla in the juices, slowly warm it up as you place the shrimp, beans, rotel mix, and cheese inside. Then crank it up to medium-high at the end for some crispiness.

I like to eat this one with sour cream. Works really well for reheating if you cook a bunch of shrimp in advance and just put the toppings in separate tupperware. I never have to actually cook the beans or tomatoes, so I usually just take them straight out of the can. I don't eat this one with vegetables as much because I'm awful and largely use it to get a good serving of protein for the day (like, I'll have a nice big salad for lunch), but you could probably just eat this with a salad or incorporate some bell peppers for cheap. With half a bag of mexican cheese and storing all the canned food at once, these can last quite a while, probably a week. However many tortillas and shrimp you have, honestly.

3. Tuna crab cakes

This is probably the most involved, but it makes for a really nice lunch! I use the flavored packets of tuna, but you could probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere. If you like the flavored ones, lemon pepper or sweet and spicy work best with this recipe. For this, you need a tuna packet, 1/2 cup or so of black beans (helps stretch the packets even further, but you can leave them out), an egg, mayonnaise, dijon mustard, lemon juice, sliced green onions, and panko bread crumbs.

Beat the egg, blend or mash the beans, then put everything in but the bread crumbs. Mix together and slowly mix in the bread crumbs until it seems to hold its shape. Shape them into patties, then throw them on medium-high heat, flipping over once the bottom gets crispy. These can be kind of messy, so just keep patting them back together.

I usually eat this one as a burger with a bun, but you could easily eat it on its own. I like to eat it with a salad or coleslaw (light on the dressing). One packet of tune and 1/2 of black beans makes about 3-4 servings for me (probably less if you don't have it with a bun), so this is the least prep-friendly, but it's pretty cheap and you can make it over and over again since mayo, eggs, and bread crumbs come in such big batches. These keep surprisingly well, too. I usually eat them cold  after the first time and lightly toast the bun. They make for a decent packed lunch.

4. Sausage and veg sheet pan

This is the ultimate easy recipe, though it takes the longest. I honestly can't bring myself to see how economical turkey sausage is since I love it so much, but I think the sausage is crucial for not having to worry about anything other than the veg getting perfectly cookd. This one is just sausage, cauliflower, broccoli, potato, and some parmesan cheese.

Place all of the ingredients evenly on aluminum foil within a sheet pan. Liberally dribble some olive oil and parmesan on top, with salt and pepper. Bake on 400 for 30-45 minutes, whenever the veg looks properly roasted.

For this one, I just bake the frozen vegetables straight from the freezer, which makes things super easy! I get these generic brand cauliflower and broccoli packets. I usually scarf this down within 4-5 sittings, using (almost) an entire thing of sausage and the whole bag of veg, plus like one potato.

Hope this is alright! Unfortunately I really don't have formal recipes, as I eyeball everything (which is what makes it ""easy"" for me). Hope you like!

EDIT: Some details that might be helpful. The shrimp are in shells, which helps with cost and makes them MUCH tastier, even though I don't cook them with the shells on (I hate peeling once they're cooked). Eating these kinds of meals + something like pasta, mushroom, ground beef, and brocc, I usually average out at $30/wk on food shopping at a not-inexpensive grocery store. Typically I just eat cereal for breakfast because I have very early mornings and need all the sleep I can get, but I doubt things would change much if you ate a proper breakfast.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figured I might share here to see if someone can get some use out of them!

I made this recently after realizing I had leftover chicken I needed to use up quickly. It's partly based on [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/df5ckg/comment/f314vmm), but I added some tweaks for more depth: I browned the butter and a little bit of chicken fat from the carcass, and threw in a small handful of cheddar and paprika for a sharper flavor. 

INGREDIENTS

3-4 cups shredded chicken
4-5 small carrots
1 cup each peas and corn
1/2 onion - or whole, if desired 
1/4 cup cream
1-2 cups broth, depending on how thin vs creamy you want it
1/2 cup sharp white cheddar
salt, pepper,garlic powder and paprika to taste
3-4 tablespoons butter
1 tbsp flour

DIRECTIONS

I used frozen peas and corn with fresh carrots, but frozen carrots should also be fine. I nuked the frozen stuff pretty quick while chopping up the carrots and onion.

Saute the onion for a minute, then add the carrot for a few more minutes before adding the rest of the veggies. You want to bring out the flavor of the veggies and make them less soggy.

Take veggies off heat. Add butter - and optionally add a pinch of chicken skin or fat. Cook butter on low heat until it turns brown.

Add flour, stir til you kinda have a roux. Add cream and broth, then stir in grated cheddar and stir quickly around until melted. 

Once it's all nice and blended, add chicken and veggies. Stir it all together. Top with paprika.

Optionally top with tin biscuits or crescent rolls, or go all out and stick in a pie crust and cook til the crust is done.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/kDazf7P""&gt;Photos here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Staple foods are things like maize, rice, potatoes, pasta, bread. Typically, i use rice, potatoes, or pasta. All types! Beans are counted in the ""protein"" section with poultry and meat but its nice to mix them in with some rice.

Veggies is self explanatory. I'd call green beans the ""universal side"" because i can't name a dish where they'd be a bad idea. I also like to use kale, broccoli stalk, lima beans, turnip, collard greens, and sweet peas. I guess if i buy peas and carrots i'd eat them, but i'm not a fan of those lol.

Finally meat. I typically eat mostly poultry like turkey and chicken and fish. Ever since i moved out, i rarely if ever buy pork chop or red meat in general. However, if i do, its either lamp chop or a simple pork chop. Other than that, you'll be good on chicken and fish really.

For the sake of simplicity, i almost *always* mix my veggies in with whatever the staple is. Rice n beans, pasta n kale, potatoes and broccoli, whatever.

As far as new recipes, i like to look up ""pasta"" version of recipes. Chicken Marsala with Ziti noodles, Curry Chicken Pasta with Fettuccine. Staples are fairly easy to replace...most of the time. Curry chicken works well with pasta or rice, as does marsala. I wouldn't however, try chicken marsala with potatoes as my base. 

If you wanna go full food pyramid mode, have a little side of fruit, yogurt, or a smoothie as a after dinner desert or snack.

For things like Pizza, Soup, and Stew, this doesn't *really* apply. However, for soup and stew, since everything is basically being cooked together, just have bread as a side.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staple+Veggies+Poultry/Meat/Beans/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

My partner and I are trying to be more health-conscious and eat less meat so this weekend we did a big meal prep to fill our freezer with lunches for the weeks ahead. We freeze portions individually then defrost the night before so that we can have a variety of meals in a week without getting bored. 


I cooked all of these in an afternoon as lots of the tasks are easy to juggle, highly recommend as now I don’t have to worry about work lunches for a couple weeks. These recipes are also easy to double without much extra effort if need be!


These ingredients made:

* 4 x carrot and ginger soup
* 8 x veggie lentil chili
* 4 x pasta sauce 
* 4 x mushroom stroganoff
* 4 x aubergine/eggplant and chickpea stew

I spent around £15 getting these ingredients but rounded up to £20 because of the cost of oil, spices and a couple cupboard staples.

Recipes:


**Carrot and ginger soup:**

* In large pot soften one onion, add minced ginger and garlic
* Stir until fragrant
* Peel and chop carrots (around 1 kg) into chunks
* Add to pot
* Add boiling water to cover with veggie stock (we use powdered Bouillon) 
* Simmer until carrots are soft
* Blend to desired consistency

Serve with dollop of sour cream

**Lenti chili**

There are a lot of good slow cooker chili options out there, personally I recommend the vegetarian lentil chili from Budget Bytes as it has black beans and kidney beans both which are super cheap, healthy and yummy.
Serve with choice of avocado/sour cream/ rice

**Pasta sauce:**

* Roasted 3 chopped red peppers with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian mixed herbs and olive oil
* Meanwhile soften 1 diced onion then add 3 crushed garlic cloves
* Chop 1 packet of mushrooms and add
* Add 2 tins of chopped tomatoes and roasted peppers

Serve with wholegrain pasta

**Mushroom stroganoff:**

I use the recipe from damn delicious with veggie stock instead of beef stock, but there are many variations on the recipe online depending if you prefer to use sour cream/cream cheese etc. 

**Aubergine and chickpea stew:**

* Chop 2 aubergines into cubes
* Add garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2tsp of cinnamon, mixed herbs, zaatar (optional but tastes great)
* Roast at 180 Celsius until soft
* In the meantime soften one chopped onion 
* Add minced garlic until fragrant
* Add 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* When hot and reduced in size add 1 can of chickpeas
* Season 
* Add aubergines when cooked
* Add more chopped tomatoes if you like it more liquid
* Add Tsp of vinegar to cut through tomato

Serve with rice, partner likes it with a big dollop of hummus on top.

Hope this is helpful!

Ingredients list:

* Mushrooms x 2 punnets
* Sour cream
* Chickpeas x tin
* Aubergines x 2
* Carrots x 2kg
* Ginger x1 inch
* Garlic x 1 head
* Black beans x 1 tin
* Brown lentils x1 bag
* Chopped toms x 5 tins
* Onions x 1kg
* Peppers x3

Our family meals have to be free from: dairy, soy, eggs, nuts, onion and wheat. Here is the breakdown:


Hubby: dairy and nut allergy
Toddler: dairy, nut and egg allergy
Baby (9m, breastfed and table food): milk and soy protien intollerance and egg allergy
Me: IBS with spelt/wheat, onion and lactose as my biggest triggers plus I cannot eat milk, soy or eggs due to breastfeeding


So as you can imagine, I not only have to get creative, but many traditional budget foods are off the list and we miss out on good deals. Sometimes I give things to my toddler but not to the baby, or the family will get wheat pasta whilst I get gluten free pasta (to avoid wheat, I am fine with gluten). But it takes a lot of juggling.


Eating cheap whilst ensuring we all eat healthy is a struggle. Like milk for instance. Hubby has soy milk which is cheap, but toddler wont touch it so gets fortified oat milk which is expensive, whilst baby and I get almond milk which is somewhere in the middle.


Toddler and hubby get cheap white bread, but it has soy flour so baby gets bakery bread which is more expensive but can be frozen. If I want the luxury of bread it has to be crazy expensive 30hr sourdough to be low fodmap and soy free so I often go without :(



I struggle with the most with breakfast and lunch. Dinner I have down but cookimg/preparing 3 meals a day, completely from scratch, whilst catering for everything is getting hard to do whilst providing a gpod variety of foods.


Oh, and my toddler wont eat fruit. Never has, not even as a baby (she will eat veg thank god).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our house, we all have some kind of an issue with food. Our family meals have to be free from: dairy, soy, eggs, nuts, onion and wheat. Here is the breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hubby: dairy and nut allergy
Toddler: dairy, nut and egg allergy
Baby (9m, breastfed and table food): milk and soy protien intollerance and egg allergy
Me: IBS with spelt/wheat, onion and lactose as my biggest triggers plus I cannot eat milk, soy or eggs due to breastfeeding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can imagine, I not only have to get creative, but many traditional budget foods are off the list and we miss out on good deals. Sometimes I give things to my toddler but not to the baby, or the family will get wheat pasta whilst I get gluten free pasta (to avoid wheat, I am fine with gluten). But it takes a lot of juggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating cheap whilst ensuring we all eat healthy is a struggle. Like milk for instance. Hubby has soy milk which is cheap, but toddler wont touch it so gets fortified oat milk which is expensive, whilst baby and I get almond milk which is somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toddler and hubby get cheap white bread, but it has soy flour so baby gets bakery bread which is more expensive but can be frozen. If I want the luxury of bread it has to be crazy expensive 30hr sourdough to be low fodmap and soy free so I often go without :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with the most with breakfast and lunch. Dinner I have down but cookimg/preparing 3 meals a day, completely from scratch, whilst catering for everything is getting hard to do whilst providing a gpod variety of foods.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a student living by myself for the first time and I’m trying really hard to eat well. When I think about the foods I eat I consider it quite healthy and balanced, however I’m worried that I mainly eat the same thing everyday. So I’m asking whether this is a bad thing? Based on my info below, do you considered my meals balanced? 

I am mainly asking this as I have had fatigue issues for the last 2 years and it hasn’t been getting better. I am also hungry very often and the doctor recommended that I put on some weight. Would love some suggestions on stopping fatigue with diet. 

This is what I typically eat;

Coffee with full cream milk (not creamer) and I one teaspoon of sugar with a 3 egg omelette with grated zucchini (courgette). I have this everyday and cannot function without breakfast. I don’t have a reliance on caffeine, and can do without if needed. 

For lunch usually a brown bread cheese and pesto sandwich with a piece of fruit and a glass of water. Or I have whole grain, rye crisp bread (not sure what it is in English, it’s a European thing) with peanut butter. I also have these as snacks and more fruit in summer. 


For dinner I always make stir fry, curry or pasta with the same ingredients. 
They are capsicum (red pepper), mushrooms, broccoli and zucchini (courgette) for every meal. I have this with either pork or chicken, sometimes beef mince for spaghetti. For pasta I make my own sauce, but for stir fry and curry I buy premade sauce. Sometimes I make white pasta and rice, sometimes brown. Mostly depends on my budget for the week. 

I make salads on days I’m not as hungry and more regularly in summer. My salads are basically again the same vegetables just with spinach and a dressing as well. 

I also have some chocolate maybe 3-4 times a week, and I probably have takeaway pizza or burgers maybe 2-3 times a month. 

Do you think I should try a greater variety of foods? With the whole 5 veg and fruit thing- I have 6 serving of which one is fruit. Is this okay?

The biggest part of our plan was to only buy food that was on sale, or what we know to be very cheap. Chicken quarters are .49/lb at our local grocery store so we got 12 lb for $6. Adding a couple carrots, onions, potatoes, a can of biscuits, and sandwich/hot dog buns (BOGO at $2.49) brought us to about $15 and we did several slow cooker meals to make BBQ chicken sandwiches, chicken salad, chicken and dumplings, and a chicken “roast”- lots of leftovers. Bell peppers were on sale for $1 each and we bought 3. Blueberries were BOGO for $4 so we got two pints, a bunch of bananas, bulk-bin rolled oats, and a pound of grapes (also on sale) for about $10. Bratwursts were were BOGO so we got two packages (10 brats) for $4. We made a big pot of red beans and rice which we added bell pepper, onion, and brats to— about $4 for the rice and beans. 18 Eggs and a loaf of bread yielded several meals (omelets with onions and bell pepper, French toast with fruit, egg salad) for about $5. Two cans of chickpeas and some seasoning paired with rice yielded 4 Indian-food style meals for less than $4. One pack of sliced cheese and two cans of tomato soup yielded four meals of grilled cheese/soup for about $5. Off brand and/or sale for virtually everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group has been helpful to us while we’ve been trying to save money so I figured I would share a few of our strategies.

In addition to being relatively cheap and healthy, it was also very easy to prepare.

&amp;#x200B;

 

### INGREDIENTS

* 8 3/4""-thick slices crusty bread
* 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 2 15-oz. cans cannellini beans, rinsed
* 1 bunch kale or mustard greens, ribs removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces
* 1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

 

### RECIPE PREPARATION

* Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Brush bread on both sides with 4 Tbsp. oil total. Working in 2 batches, cook bread, pressing occasionally to help crisp, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Season toast with salt and pepper and set aside.
* Increase heat to medium-high and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in same skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
* Add beans and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to blister, about 3 minutes. Using a spoon, lightly mash about half of the beans. Add kale and broth and cook, tossing often, until kale is wilted, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.
* Serve beans and greens mixture over toast, drizzled with oil.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says I do not have a stove/oven and I do not have a microwave. I DO have a crockpot, a rice cooker, a small toaster oven, and a fridge/freezer to store. As it stands I do not use these tools nearly as efficiently as I could be. I spend probably 300-400 a month on groceries for myself (technically this includes dish soap, paper towels, etc. but these don&amp;#39;t have a huge impact every month) and I&amp;#39;m hoping to lower that number closer to 100 or 200. There is a microwave I can use at work to reheat food, and I guess technically I do have my own microwave. But all of my kitchen appliances are in boxes for an unknown amount of time since I do not have the money for cabinets to put the kitchen together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty much an amateur at this kind of thing and money is getting very tight for me. I&amp;#39;ve never meal prepped a day in my life and I honestly don&amp;#39;t even know where to start since my tools feel so limited and I want to be as cheap and efficient as possible here. So please send me any and all of your ideas, I&amp;#39;m not a picky eater and if there&amp;#39;s a recipe that has something I don&amp;#39;t like in it I can always find an alternative or just take it out. And I know that with what I have there is a lot that I can do. I just don&amp;#39;t really know how and there is so much information that I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start. Thank you ahead of time for any help.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

My week for dinner consists of:

One box of packaged leafy greens (or fresh)

Whichever protein source is on sale (chicken, beef, etc)

....and thats it.

In CAD, my total for the week comes up to $12 before tax (ex. one box of arugula, chicken breasts).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by setting my plate with the greens, and cook my protein source on the side (very simple: salt, pepper, &amp; herbs).

Spice to taste, sauce on the side, plate &amp; enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

Combinations of the two that i've made are:

Baby Arugula Blend &amp; Rib Eye Steak (Cooked Medium)

Spring Mix &amp; Chicken Strips (Topped w/ Alfredo Sauce)

Sauteed Green Beans &amp; Spring Mix, Tossed w/ Chicken Breast Chunks

Kale Blend &amp; Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin

Meat and Arugula Bowl (Literally Arugula and Chicken, tossed with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce)

&amp;#x200B;

This simple shopping list makes trips to the grocery, so so easy!

Cooking your own meat can be daunting at first, but make the pan your best friend! A little bit of oil &amp; butter goes a loooong way.

Experiment on what you're feeling, overcomplicating recipes/things can be such a hassle and take up so much time and energy.

2. While quinoa cooks, chop up all veggies, and add them to a large saucepan with a little olive oil on med-high heat.  Cook 5-7 minutes tossing occasionally. In the last minute add sunflower seeds and combine with veggies. Set aside mixture in (VERY) large bowl.
3. In the same pan you cooked the veggies, add more olive oil and cook the ground sausage, around 7-10 minutes
4. Once sausage is cooked, add it and the quinoa to the large bowl of veggie mixture. Toss all ingredients together. Season to taste.

Boom, you're done. Eat warm or cold, wrap it in a tortilla and have a taco, add to noodles and make weird pasta salad. Seriously, this stuff is good on anything.

**INGREDIENTS** (everything is optional): 

* 2 cups Israeli couscous, aka pearl couscous (it's actually pasta, shhhh) 
* Handful of raisins, maybe a quarter cup or so 
* Tin of chickpeas, rinsed and drained (use dried chickpeas to make it even cheaper) 
* Feta - however much you have

* Sumac powder (incredibly tasty magical seasoning found at all fine Middle Eastern stores) 
* Olive oil for cooking and more for drizzling 
* TOTALLY OPTIONAL BUT NICE TO ADD AT THE END: Fresh parsley, lemon, hot sauce, green onions; really whatever you have around 

**WHAT YOU DO:** 

* Boil a bunch of water and cook the couscous and raisins until just tender. (Add salt to the water, as well as olive oil to keep it from sticking together.) Drain. 
* While the couscous is cooking, heat up some olive oil in another pan. 
* While the oil is heating, mince the garlic. 
* Cook the garlic a couple of minutes, then sprinkle on a BUNCH of sumac - a tablespoon or more. 
* Throw the chickpeas in with the garlic and cook a few minutes. Add some salt. I like salt. But don't go nuts if you're also adding feta. 
* Throw in the couscous and raisins, mix it all up, cook a few more minutes. Crumble in some feta. 
* Eat it right now. Dial it up by adding parsley, lemon and/or hot sauce. Whatever.

*Mexican Chorizo Spice Blend:*

\---&gt; *”toastables”* (toast for 3-4 minutes in 350F oven)

\- Ancho Chili Powder, 3 tbsp \*deseeded for less spicy

\- Cumin Seed, 2 tbsp

\- Black Peppercorns, 12 whole 

\- Coriander Seed, 2 tsp

\- Whole Cloves, 10 cloves

\- Bay Leaves, 3 medium leaves

\---&gt; *“Non-toastables”*

\- Ground Cinnamon ½ tsp

\- Mexican Oregano Dry, 1 tsp

\- Fresh Thyme, 1 tsp

\- Paprika (hot or sweet), 5 tbsp \*Use hot paprika for more of a kick

\- Cayenne, 1 tsp

\- Kosher Salt, ½ tsp and more to taste

&amp;#x200B;

\- Fresh Garlic, minced 2 cloves

\- Apple Cider Vinegar 3 tbsp

\- Garnish - ½ cup loosely packed chopped cilantro

**Chipotle Lime Crema:**

\- Creme Fraiche or Sour Cream, ¼ cup

\- Chipotle in Adobo, 1 tbsp 

\- Fresh Lime Juice, ½ small lime plus more to taste

\- Kosher Salt, ½ tsp plus more to taste

**Soft-Boiled Egg Tips:**

\- Bring water to boil, then GENTLY add in eggs. Cook for 6.5 minutes. Shock in ice water for 3-4 minutes.

\- “Fridge cold” eggs, aka eggs directly taken from the fridge, are fine. No need to bring to room temp.

\- I find eggs are easier to peel under running water or completely submerged. The water seeps in between the cracks of the eggs to help the shell come off the egg.

For me it would have to be:  
Oatmeal 10lb box $8.99 .89c lb (Smart &amp; Final)    
Homemade Popcorn from kernels $2.49 45 oz (Target)  
Canned pineapple .99c can (Target)    
Peanut butter $2 jar  (Various)

Eggs 20 count about $3 .15c each (Smart &amp; Final)    
Flax seed ground 1lb $3 (Smart &amp; final)
  
Been making [this recipe](https://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipes/peanut-butter-and-banana-energy-bites) for no cook energy bites with the oatmeal &amp; peanut butter. I sometimes add sunflower seeds to the mix &amp; chocolate chips are a good addition as well
  
For breakfast I usually eat some oatmeal with some ground flaxseed mixed in.  
  
I eat a lot of re-fried beans with scrambled eggs on the side. Heat up some oil on low &amp; fry some ground cumin &amp; hot pepper flakes for like a min. Add beans &amp; mash. Add some of the bean cooking liquid to get your desired consistency.   
  
I make popcorn or eat sunflower seeds when I want a snack.  I add extra virgin olive oil on top of the popcorn &amp; mix. I also grind my salt in a coffee grinder until it is a powder &amp; sprinkle on top with an old spice jar. Sticks way better than the larger crystals. For more tips check out this episode of [good eats](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5skvse) 
  
Eggs I usually scramble but when I am in the mood I make [Chinese Steamed Eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QbeSQLvdlE). Great with whole grain of your choice like brown rice or quinoa.  
  
With the canned pineapple I add chopped oranges and make a super simple fruit salad.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your favorite low cost/healthy foods that you eat? What do you make with it?  &lt;/p&gt;

Oatmeal 10lb box $8.99 .89c lb (Smart &amp;amp; Final)&lt;br/&gt;
Homemade Popcorn from kernels $2.49 45 oz (Target)&lt;br/&gt;
Canned pineapple .99c can (Target)&lt;br/&gt;
Peanut butter $2 jar  (Various)&lt;br/&gt;
Roasted/salted sunflower seeds $2 lb(trader joes)&lt;br/&gt;
Pinto beans 50 lb bag $24.99 .50c lb (Smart &amp;amp; Final)&lt;br/&gt;
Eggs 20 count about $3 .15c each (Smart &amp;amp; Final)&lt;br/&gt;
Flax seed ground 1lb $3 (Smart &amp;amp; final)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been making &lt;a href=""https://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipes/peanut-butter-and-banana-energy-bites""&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; for no cook energy bites with the oatmeal &amp;amp; peanut butter. I sometimes add sunflower seeds to the mix &amp;amp; chocolate chips are a good addition as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For breakfast I usually eat some oatmeal with some ground flaxseed mixed in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat a lot of re-fried beans with scrambled eggs on the side. Heat up some oil on low &amp;amp; fry some ground cumin &amp;amp; hot pepper flakes for like a min. Add beans &amp;amp; mash. Add some of the bean cooking liquid to get your desired consistency.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make popcorn or eat sunflower seeds when I want a snack.  I add extra virgin olive oil on top of the popcorn &amp;amp; mix. I also grind my salt in a coffee grinder until it is a powder &amp;amp; sprinkle on top with an old spice jar. Sticks way better than the larger crystals. For more tips check out this episode of &lt;a href=""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5skvse""&gt;good eats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eggs I usually scramble but when I am in the mood I make &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QbeSQLvdlE""&gt;Chinese Steamed Eggs&lt;/a&gt;. Great with whole grain of your choice like brown rice or quinoa.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the canned pineapple I add chopped oranges and make a super simple fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;

We host drinks for our team of 25 every Friday and I've been using it as an excuse to get creative with cooking in the office. We have a microwave, toaster oven and a panini press. We have a relatively health-conscious young crew (some veg, some vegan, mostly omnivores). Some fun themed weeks I've come up with include:

Middle Eastern - warmed pita, hummus, babaganoush, oven-crisped falafel.

Ice Cream Social - Dairy and non-dairy ice creams with healthy and not-so-healthy toppings

Ballgame - Mini hot dogs (vegan and non), relish, mustard and ketchup, mini burgers (vegan and non)

Build-your-own Chex mix - Popcorn, Chex, chocolates, nuts, dried fruit

Chicken and Waffles - vegan waffles topped with oven-crisped chicken tenders (vegan and non) with syrup (low cal and not)

Design-your-own mug cake - vegan and non cake batter (made from scratch) with fresh berries, chocolate, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, whipped cream (dairy and non)

I like there to be a little bit of interactivity because the point of the drinks is for everyone to relax and socialize at the end of the week.

One of my pantry staples is a variety of raw nuts. These are initially pretty expensive but the last a long time and are versatile, which makes them a good investment for your pantry in the long run. Plus, nutritionally nuts are some of the greatest bang for your buck. A couple Brazil nuts contain enough Selinium to meet your requirements for the week. There are also [studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/well/eat/walnuts-for-weight-loss.amp.html) that suggest that adding nuts to your diet, while calorically dense, can help you lose weight. Because of the high calorie content and good fats, they keep you satiated for longer than a lot of other food choices you could make. Raw nuts are versatile for me because I also use them to make my own nut milk, which is [super easy](https://youtu.be/TQtRv-wdaJU) to make if you haven’t tried. All you need is a blender and either cheese cloth or a special nut milk bag. Nut milk is pretty expensive to buy premade imo. Although keep in mind that a homemade version has a much shorter shelf life (about 3-4 days in your fridge).    

On to snack mixes! Lightly roast nuts in the oven with salt (most nuts take about 8ish minutes at 400 degrees F). Keep it that simple and just add some dried fruit or other seeds (I also like cacao nibs) and call it a day. Or you can also season the nuts with basically anything you like. Some of my favorites are: rosemary and Parmesan, chili powder, curry powder, wasabi powder, and most recently this absolutely divine [savory and spicy rosemary recipe](https://www.nospoonnecessary.com/savory-spicy-rosemary-roasted-nuts/).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack mixes are really expensive to buy premade, but you can make your own for way less and it allows you to customize to your own tastes or experiment with flavors!    &lt;/p&gt;

This lemon-dill chicken with cauliflower is a quick, healthy weeknight dinner option that is endlessly versatile. 

**Amendments:**

Replace the cauliflower with any anything from potatoes to zucchini or broccoli. You can serve over cooked rice or with mashed potatoes or cooked orzo. You can also add asparagus or sugar snap peas during the last few minutes of cooking for crisp, bright finish.

You can replace the chicken with chicken thighs, drumsticks, or with pork tenderloin or chops. Just amend the cooking time, as needed. You can also make this vegetarian or vegan with a can of chickpeas or cannellini beans instead of chicken.

## Grade:

Serves: 4

Cost: $4.25 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 45 minutes (20 minutes inactive)

## Ingredients Lemon-Dill Chicken with Cauliflower

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

1 head of cauliflower, trimmed and cut into florets

1 pint cherry tomatoes

3 cups chicken stock

2 tablespoons butter, optional

3 sprigs of thyme (or 1 teaspoon dry thyme)

1 teaspoon paprika

1 teaspoon garlic powder

2 tablespoons freshly chopped fresh dill, plus more for serving

1 lemon, divided

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

Extra virgin olive oil

## Method

## Prepare the Chicken:

Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.

In a wide sauté pan, heat the neutral oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook without moving for 4-5 minutes until well-browned. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

## Cook the Onions:

If the pan seems dry, add another drizzle of oil. Once hot, add the onions to the pan and cook until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Stir the onions regularly to ensure they aren’t sticking.

## Sauté the Cauliflower:

Add the cauliflower florets to the pan and cook for 5 minutes or until they just begin to turn golden brown in spots. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute or two.

## Prepare the Broth:

Pour the chicken stock into the pan and scrape up any browned bits. Bring to a boil and season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Add the butter, if desired, and then reduce heat to low and add the thyme sprigs. Once the butter has melted, nestle the chicken into the broth.

## Cook the Chicken:

Cut the ends off the lemon and squeeze the juice from the ends over the chicken. Cut the middle of the lemon into four rounds and place a round on each chicken breast. Sprinkle the chopped dill on top.

Cover and simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken reaches 160ºF. If you prefer not to broil the chicken, simply cook until the chicken reaches 165ºF and proceed with serving and skip the next step.

## Broil the Chicken (Optional):

Turn the broiler on to high. Remove the lid from the pan and drizzle the chicken with extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 5 minutes or until the lemon rounds char and the tops of the chicken breasts turn golden brown and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165ºF. Remove from the broiler.

## To Serve:

Spoon the cauliflower and tomatoes into shallow bowls and spoon the broth over top. Serve the chicken on top and garnish with more fresh dill. Drizzle each dish with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIC: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/gKuDVTA.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/gKuDVTA.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And it can be very budget friendly! Here is what I have been doing recently for make ahead lunches or quick dinners.

For one bowl, I will use a quarter of a frozen bag of corn($.25), half a can of black beans($0.50), half of a slice of tempeh($1) or other meat substitute, and half a cup of either brown rice($0.50) or quinoa($1).
Plus various spices. That is about $3.75 for a high protein fiesta bowl that tastes pretty good! Also that price can be brought down slightly of the ingredients are bought in bulk.

I usually fry the tempeh for 5 minutes each side over medium high heat until golden brown with a dash of soy sauce or just salt and pepper depending on whats on hand. While that is cooking I start the rice or quinoa, either a rice cooker or on the stove. After the tempeh is golden brown, I remove it from the pan turn the heat to low and add a little more oil. I toss in the frozen corn and let it grill for a few minutes on high heat, it is best when it turns golden brown and gets grill marks! Finally, I will add the can half a can of black beans without draining it and let it cook for about 5 minutes. I usually season it with a little bit of garlic powder, chili pepper, salt, and cayenne and dried cilantro. Optionally, you could get super fancy and serve it with some lime juice squeezed on top and a couple scoops of salsa!

This process ussually takes me about 20 minutes start to finish and only dirties two pans(one for the quinoa/rice and one for stir frying the other stuff) and one dish.

Once the water was discarded, I'd through the tuna in a pan and fry it, normally with no oil since it's already fatty, for a minute or so, just to warm it up and get it a bit crispy. I'd throw it over the lettuce, add salt and pepper, and then squeeze some lemon.  Finally, I'd add about 1/3-1/2 an avocado. Because of the fat in the tuna and avocado, it's savory enough to not require any dressing.  I'm lucky enough that we grow our own avocados, lemons, and tomatoes, which I sometimes add as well.  I know avocados aren't the cheapest, but often times you can find them for a dollar a piece.  And if you only use 1/3-1/2 at a time, I think it's a great addition to the salad. Lettuce is about $1-2 for 3 heads here. And to save money on lemons, you could just be lemon juice. Just thought I'd give this simple, quick meal that helped me lose weight a shout.

Long time lurker, but I wanted to share my favorite quick, cheap, and healthy meal!

I really like to buy one dollar (US) bags of frozen peas because they are so cheap for such a versatile veggie, then pour a portion of them into a bowl, add a splash of water, then cover and microwave for 2 minutes. They are supposed to cook in the bag, but I don't ever eat a whole bag at once so this works too.  

Then, I usually have left over rice because it is one of my favorite foods, so I add about half rice and half peas and microwave for another minute. Fresh from the rice maker works too, but I just mix and microwave the peas for one minute more on their own usually then add the fresh rice. 

Then, I cook 2 eggs in a pan with salt and pepper and add the rice and peas and mix once the eggs are fully cooked. In the pan, I turn off the heat and add soy sauce, chili sauce with garlic, black pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder. 

The end result is so good, super quick, and pretty filling. Hope you all enjoy!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
