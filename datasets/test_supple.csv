GNC L-Tyrosine 1000mg; Sometimes I use this the day after stimulant usage but very rarely because its hard having an empty stomach required to absorb it.

200mg L-Theanine; I take this paired with energy drinks/coffee sometimes, as well for occasional anxiety

Goals are: general well-being, longevity, preventing cancers and other serious health problems in the long run, neuroprotection, help with anxiety, depressions (not having one currently but it's a recurrent issue), brain fog (also on and off), rebuilding myself after years of bad diet and sleep habits, and smoking. 

Basic stack I want to keep indefinitely: 

- marine collagen peptides (scoop) + hyaluronic acid (120mg) + vit C (1000mg for now, want to order a lower dose next time) + MSM (2.5g). I've noticed a positive effect on my skin &amp; hair, and joint pain with these. 

- magnesium (still trying to find a good form. Tried Mg oxide+Calcium+Zinc+D3, magnesium Optimizer (malate+taurine+B6+potassium), l-threonate). Blood tests show I'm barely above the minimum threshold even though I've been taking magnesium supplements for a couple of years. Both threonate and malate put me to sleep, but the Optimizer one also gives me bad brain fog the next day (maybe it's the taurine, idk).

- lutein (20mg) + zeaxanthin (4mg) + astaxanthin (8-12mg). have myopia and a family history of eye problems, so want to keep my eyes as healthy as possible.

- Omega 3s (fish oil, EPO, flax seed (thinking of dropping the flax as it gets rancid too quickly)

- vit D3 (5000iu until I get out of deficit, then going to take 2000iu for maintenance) + mk7 + 200mg of calcium (don't get enough from diet, monitoring my blood levels, they're fine for now).

- B complex (finishing my Solgar 50, then switching to B-right for methylated forms and lower doses. My B12 is (barely) within range despite my being vegetarian since early childhood and not taking a methylated form, so I probably don't have a methylation issue(?). 

Things I want to cycle/take one-two times a week:

- iron 18mg (went from hemochromatosis to anemia in a year) until I'm no longer anemic, then maybe 1 time a week just in case)

- zinc, selenium 

- maca root (mood, energy, libido - but it gives me vivid trippy nightmares) 

- l theanine (for anxiety as needed, sometimes gives me brain fog without caffeine)

- creatine (just 1mg dose when I desperately need energy/focus; I want to love it but it disagrees with my bipolar, bad).


Things I might add to this if they work for me (waiting for order to arrive): 

- NAC (supposed to be good for bipolar, prevent some cancers, help with lung function and liver)

- lithium orotate (want to try micro-dosing lithium to see if it might be enough to stabilize my mood before I go for prescribed carbonate (predisposed to issues the therapeutic dose can cause as a side-effect)

- reishi mashrooms or AHCC (predisposed to cervical cancer, studies show promise here) 

- astragalus (longevity + cancer prevention) 

- ubiquinol (recommended here a lot)

- silica? (for skin and joints, can't figure out the best source/form)


Dropping the ashwagandha as I think it's not doing much for me. 

I want to keep it simple and eventually just leave the ""essential"" stuff, dropping what doesn't work for me. I'm also wondering if I might have missed some safety concerns regarding my choices. Any insight/advice is appreciated!

Where I live (in Europe, near France) supplements are expensive and choice is limited. For the most part I've ordered from the US (Solgar, Life Extension, Jarrow, etc...), the UK (Holland &amp; Barret, Nature's Best, Higher Nature, etc...) and sometimes from France or Belgium (Arkopharma, OM3, etc...).

Here's my pickle: i can't quite set my mind of what's the safest country when it comes to buying my supplements (when comparing equally high quality brands).

**Here's my conclusion so far:**  


* **US supplements:**

**+** by far the largest choice and most internationally reputable brands, at a fair price. I like that there are independent labs testing products, such as ConsumerLab. Americans are big consumer of supplements, and their brands are sold worldwide, so there are lots of discussion on forums discussing products.

**-** there are no or very few regulations on supplements, and sometimes scandals about purity and such (granted it seems to be mostly for unknown shady companies selling sexual enhancing, bodybuilding or weight lost supplements). Some GMO derived products. The occasional tax when ordering outside the US, that could get worse with the current trade tensions between American and Europe.  


* **UK supplements:**

**+** seems to be the best of both worlds, as there are lots of choices and stricter regulations ensuring possibly safer supplements. No customs or taxes when ordering from the EU.

**-** with the whole Brexit mess, there might be soon strict customs when ordering outside the UK. Also the crashing economy doesn't inspire confidence in the ability of the UK to ensure their laws. Overall slightly lower quality product compared to the US.  


* **European supplements:**

**+** strict regulations and controls, making supplements safer in theory (tough i can't say if that's a fact, or just European being patriotic or anti-US), more reasonable dosage (no possibly unsafe ""mega"" dose of, for example, of b vitamins), cheap delivery with no customs or taxes at all.

**-** fewer brands, many of which are harder to know their reputation as very few people talk about it (Europeans aren't heavy users of supplements), very high price compare to the US or UK, sometimes lower quality ingredients (for example magnesium oxide instead of citrate or chelated, probably because Europeans don't care or believe much in supplements), some basic supplements are almost non existent or hard to find, due to stricter regulations or low demand.

Take c4 shredded sometimes to get a workout in after a long day.

Looking to get joint health the most important. Lose weight till goal.

Thinking I don’t need the cissus maybe add in collagen?

6 months ago I stopped drinking coffee or take any caffeine in any form, mainly because I love the effect of it. As usual I started gaining tolerance, so I decided to stop drinking daily coffees and just use it whenever I actually need it. 

At the moment I drink only 1 shot of esspresso per week, right before a sport excercise Im about to take - football game or tennis. And it feels so good during the game - im full of energy and perform at my best each time. 

My question is, how often can I drink coffee in order to keep that effect whenever I need it, because i quite enjoy drinking coffee at all, but i avoid it on purpose? If I drink two conescutive days - in the weekend, and then dont drink any until the next weekend, will there be enough time to get clear?

fyi im taking daily multivitamin complex with standart dosage of different vitamins and minerals, just as addition to my food.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been experimenting with caffeine in the gym to boost my moral and performance while weight lifting. I do not drink coffee regularly, but if I do, I am rather jittery and come down unnoticeably during the day. I’ve came down from molly, LSD, and Adderall with no problems. For some reason, caffeine destroys me a little bit as a person. I took ~200mg on an empty stomach and my workout was insane, I was pushing myself like never before, and I was flying high... all until I went to stretch. Literally the world was without happiness. I was miserable. I ate, drank, slept, had sex. Felt slightly better. Went to bed. The next morning I had to skip my classes because I was again morose and felt without energy until the evening. So I downed the dosage to 100mg with food and plenty of water and tried that 4 days. (Note: I don’t eat after working out because I try to do only 2 large meals a day. Maybe I should try a snack after working out?)The feelings are much muted, but still similar. My workouts are still energized, but not as much. I am still very pissy towards people after my workout and tend to be very glum for the rest of the day. I also get mini migraines now? Which I never used to. It appears like I shouldn’t use the caffeine, but I am so apathetic about working out. It’s like I can be miserable during or after. My boyfriend and a girl friend of ours both take 300mg+ of caffeine and are like the Winnie the Pooh and piglet to my eeyore post workout. 

Is there any supplement like caffeine that won’t turn me into a monster? Ideally not going to wreck my body long term, allow me to pass a drug test, and well studied.  OR should I try drinking tea after workout out to ease myself down while my body adjusts? Or take even less caffeine? Any suggestions are appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with caffeine in the gym to boost my moral and performance while weight lifting.

I wondered, what should my first reddit post look like. While pondering over that, I felt that my right side of the head started to hurt, eyes twitch, body temperature rising out of nowhere and the feeling of irritation taking me somewhere where I try to stay away from. 

This is a short glimpse of my ""mildly"" sensitive nervous system. Just when I've reached the age of 26, I started understanding my brain and body better (with the help of a psychotherapist). Unfortunately, it felt a bit too late for me since I've been feeling down for quite a while now, but with the help of certain activities and supplements, I've managed to get my shit together, at least a bit.   


Now, two weeks after a surgery, feeling all weak, irritated and uncomfortable, I've started taking supplements again, since neuralgia is killing me and constant nervousness is making me unbearable. The supplements I take consists of all B group vitamins and Magnesium and it **did helped me to cope, a bit**. Unfortunately, I have to take all three different brands at once and I'm quite sure I'm taking more than I need, but only taking all of them at once, I feel some changes. And it been like so forever because I can't seem to find the right brands or maybe I'm doing something wrong. Doctors don't help much, besides repeatedly telling me to take these supplements.    


**TLDR**: I would appreciate if someone could share with me knowledge about brands for supplements of Magnesium, B group vitamins etc. Is there anything particular that I need to know about taking these supplements (have basic knowledge, since I did some research, but you know..). And most important - what are your experiences?

&lt;p&gt;I wondered, what should my first reddit post look like. While pondering over that, I felt that my right side of the head started to hurt, eyes twitch, body temperature rising out of nowhere and the feeling of irritation taking me somewhere where I try to stay away from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short glimpse of my &amp;quot;mildly&amp;quot; sensitive nervous system. Just when I&amp;#39;ve reached the age of 26, I started understanding my brain and body better (with the help of a psychotherapist). Unfortunately, it felt a bit too late for me since I&amp;#39;ve been feeling down for quite a while now, but with the help of certain activities and supplements, I&amp;#39;ve managed to get my shit together, at least a bit.   &lt;/p&gt;

I've done some search and I'm considering 5-HTP to increase my deep sleep and to get better results with my inflammatory bowel syndrome. I've came across L-theanine as well, because I have anxiety in a daily basis, with some mild depressive crises now and then.

But then I come to a question...
1 - Can I have L-theanine with my morning coffee and 5-HTP before bed time?
2 - Is there any side-effects I should consider before taking them?
3 - Is there any trouble to mix them both in my daily routine?
