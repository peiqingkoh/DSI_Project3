Unfortunately, it felt a bit too late for me since I've been feeling down for quite a while now, but with the help of certain activities and supplements, I've managed to get my shit together, at least a bit.   


Now, two weeks after a surgery, feeling all weak, irritated and uncomfortable, I've started taking supplements again, since neuralgia is killing me and constant nervousness is making me unbearable. The supplements I take consists of all B group vitamins and Magnesium and it **did helped me to cope, a bit**. Unfortunately, I have to take all three different brands at once and I'm quite sure I'm taking more than I need, but only taking all of them at once, I feel some changes. And it been like so forever because I can't seem to find the right brands or maybe I'm doing something wrong. Doctors don't help much, besides repeatedly telling me to take these supplements.

Both times this happened, I only used about 2.5g of creatine monohydrate from a good brand, no additives mentioned on the label, first time two days in a row, the next time just one day. The effect was noticeable in about a couple of hours and reached its peak on day 2-3 after last dose, then slowly wearing off. That shit was out of control, the restlesslessness, the energy, the insanely good mood, and racing thoughts. I nearly ended up hospitalized and now I'm diagnosed as Bipolar. 

I don't blame creatine for that, I looked back on my life and realized that's been the case for quite a while, but I didn't realize before that depressions weren't my only problem. If it hadn't been for this, I might have never figured out those other periods were destructive for me and were in fact hypomanias, just not as wild as the one I had on creatine. 

Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of studies done on this, and I know some bipolar people take creatine with no issue, but for some reason in my case, it's a bad, bad reaction IMMEDIATELY, not after three weeks like in a study I found on supplementing creatine in depressed people, two of whom were bipolar. Also, creatine kinase levels were found to be elevated in bipolar patients going through hypomania/mania in another study (no supplementation).

My body now seems to be accepting sleep a lot quicker and I tend to sleep in a lot later now which I didn't do before. This may be down to exercise and magnesium which I take in the morning and the magnesium salt baths before bed. I also have switched normal tea out for green tea which help me to feel more awake.

I'm sorry if this isn't the correct place to ask. Other Reddit pages have redirected me here. I just want to know if there is something that can help either reduce MPB, or combat my stress levels which I think may be related. Another note - I'm currently using Alpecine caffeine shampoo and Minoxidil foam each day (not the pills as I've heard bad side effects for them). If anyone can give me some advice I would be very grateful. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I&amp;#39;m mainly asking this for healthier lifestyle options. I know there isn&amp;#39;t a miracle cure for baldness. I just want to know if there are any supplements that can aid in fighting male pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 26 and my hair is thinning badly on the top of my head. Doctors ruled this to be MPB and just accept it, as there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any medical condition causing it. My recent years have endured a lot of stress from work and finances, lack of sleep and bad eating, which I believe to have increased this process.&lt;/p&gt;

But I&amp;#39;d like everyone to try this for depression. Take a multi-vitamin, if you don&amp;#39;t normally take them, take 2 at once, then take 2gms of l-tryptophan. With an adaptogen blend that has rhodiola roscea (I should say &amp;quot;preferably&amp;quot;). Let me list the ingredients right now. Curcuma, Schizandra, American Ginsing, Eleuthero, Rhodiola, Galanga, Turmeric, Astragalus, Ginger, the first 6 dosed at 100mg, the last 3 are lower. I also took l-tyrosine this morning like I normally do with l-citrulline. Oh and 225mcg iodine. Forgot to mention that too with my normal multi-B. Came home, took 2gms of l-tryptophan with this adaptogenic blend... HOLY COW. OMG I feel good. Everyone needs to try something close to this at least once I really feel unbelievably perfect right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps. I just found out this specific adaptogen blend is actually discontinued. But amazon sells a few similar products I really think any, dosed after a multi vitamin &amp;amp; l-tryptophan can seriously tune up your serotonin. Music sounds great right now. It usually isn&amp;#39;t this enjoyable just to hear music. Now it is very enjoyable. There is a clear effect there. Mood is also tuned up &amp;amp; I feel subtly euphoric.

\*Edit: Fixing grammar","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, first time on this sub. I&amp;#39;ve always seen people recommending fish oil as the most important essential supplement to take, ocwe any other vitamin. However, I&amp;#39;m basically allergic to every common food that are rich in these. I am anaphylactic to ALL seafood and ALL nuts, so that crosses out fish and walnuts off the list unless I want to die. This leaves me with just plant based alternatives such as chia seeds and/or flax seeds which I&amp;#39;m allergic to in trace amounts. I can only have a little bit and even then it&amp;#39;s extremely uncomfortable because my throat will start to swell up and it&amp;#39;s difficult to breathe, how can I incorporate omega 3 fatty acids into my diet? Not sure if it&amp;#39;s relevant but I do have quite a lot of fruits and veggies in my diet just normally.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m posting on behalf of my friend. 

She has been bed bound for a long period of time due to chronic illness and likely has some muscle wastage from not moving around enough. 

She is wanting to start drinking a daily protein drink to give her extra nutrients and help repair or rebuild her muscles a little, if this is even possible. She will hopefully be combining this with some light exercise. 

We’ve been researching brands like Huel, Soylent and MyProtein but don’t know what to go for. Does anyone have any recommendations? We are based in the UK. 

Also, how many times per day would you recommend one of these drinks as a meal replacement?

Finally, should it be consumed before or after exercise?

I found on ConsumerLab a study of  bioavailability  curcumin formulations made by themselves. 

\- https://www.consumerlab.com/news/turmeric-and-curcumin/04-04-2017/

the same here  :

\- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006023

Maybe you know what I'm talking about, if not , watch  here , will be interesting.

Based on the literature search, 11 curcumin formulations with available human bioavailability and pharmacokinetics data were included in this review. Further, the data on clinical study design, analytical method, pharmacokinetic parameters and other relevant details of each formulation were extracted.

Based on a review of these studies, it's evident that better bioavailability of formulated curcumin products is mostly attributed to improved solubility, stability, and possibly low first-pass metabolism. The review hopes to provide a quick reference guide for anyone looking information on these bioavailable curcumin formulations.

Based on the published reports we have :

\-NovaSol = 185 x

\- Curcuwin =136 x

\- Longvida = 100 x

\- Meriva = 48 x

\- BCM 95 = 27 x 

\- C3 complex +bioperine = 20 x

\- Theracurmin = 16 x 

So , I considered the most frequently used brands by myself . Prices from Amazon .

Basically, the capsules are formed from : the active part + improvement  additives .

I noted SC =  standard curcumin bioavailable in the body (free curcumin + metabolites)

I did the math  :

\-1 capsule NovaSol = 750 mg ,active substance = 40mg x 185 = 7.4 grams SC

Full spectrum curcumin from Solgar, 30 gels ; 22.49 $ ; 0.75$ /gel ; 0.75 $/7.4 = **1gr. SC = 0.11 $**

\- 1capsule Curcuwin = 250 mg , active substance 20% = 50 mg x 136 = 6.8 grams SC

Relentless Improvement CurcuWin , 60 capsules ; 26.95 $ ; 0.45$ /capsule; 0.45 $ /6.8= **1gr.SC=0.07 $**

\- 1 capsule Longvida = 400 mg , active substance 20 % = 80 mg x 100 = 8  grams SC

NOW Supplements,Curcubrain , 50 capsules ; 33.70 $ ; 0.68$ /capsule ; 0.68 $ /8 = **1 gr. SC = 0.09 $**

\- 1 capsule Meriva =500 mg ,active substance 18-22%  = 100mg = 0.1 grams x 47 = 4.7 grams SC

Jarrow Formulas Curcumin Phytosome, 60 caps. ; 13.12 $ ; 0.22$ /capsule; 0.22$ /4.7 =**1gr. SC = 0.05 $**

\- 1 capsule BCM 95 = 400 mg ,active substance =380mg = 0.380 grams x 27 = 10.26 grams SC

Life Extension SuperBio Curcumin ,60 caps. ; 21.79 $ ; 0.37$ /capsule ; 0.37 $ /10.26 = **1gr. SC =**  **0.04 $**

\- 1 capsule C3 Complex = 500 mg ,active substance = 475mg = 0.475 grams x 20 = 9.5 grams SC

Turmeric Curcumin C3 Complex SR , 120 caps. ; 21.64 $ ; 0.18$ /capsule; 0.18 $ /9.5 = **1gr. SC = 0.02 $**

**-** 1 capsule  Theracurmin = 600mg , active substance = 60mg = 0.06 grams x 16 = 0.96 grams SC

CurcuminRich Theracurmin , 60 capsules ; 38.47 $ ; 0.65 $/capsule ; 0.65 $ /0.96 = **1gr. SC = 0.68 $**

What about that ?... Before drawing the conclusions we must consider :

1.  The  bioavailability  is not the same with the time of staying in the body , otherwise it would mean that C3 Complex is more bioavailable than Theracurmin. Absurd.

2. The bioavailability doesn't reflect the medical potency of the product. Show me a cancer trial with Curcuwin.

3. The bioavailability doesn't influence the specific medical properties of a curcumin formulation. Being a sick man I noticed the different effects of different formulations .

4. The bioavailability differs very much with each brand for the same formulation . I'm convinced that each of you noticed this.

5. Some prices are insanely and by no mean  practically justified.

&lt;p&gt;What about that ?... Before drawing the conclusions we must consider :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  bioavailability  is not the same with the time of staying in the body , otherwise it would mean that C3 Complex is more bioavailable than Theracurmin. Absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bioavailability doesn&amp;#39;t reflect the medical potency of the product. Show me a cancer trial with Curcuwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bioavailability doesn&amp;#39;t influence the specific medical properties of a curcumin formulation. Being a sick man I noticed the different effects of different formulations .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bioavailability differs very much with each brand for the same formulation . I&amp;#39;m convinced that each of you noticed this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prices are insanely and by no mean  practically justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

(Please note: I'm only listing my supplements below, not my prescribed meds. I get that my meds and my ailments can affect the efficacy of supplements and vice versa, but for now I'd really appreciate some advice based just on the supplements.)

My current day:

**First thing**

Berberine extract 400mg

Oregano Oil 500mg

**About 11 a.m.**

Big bowl of plain Greek yoghurt 

Lactase tablet

Vit. K2 75ug

D3 2000iu

1000mg magnesium glycinate/lysinate

**About 7 p.m.**

Meal, if I have one at all -- I'm trying to get better about it -- involving the few things I can eat 

Vit. B6 100mg

Folic Acid 400ug

Digestive enzymes

B12 75ug

Chorella &amp; Spirulina tablets - 5 or so, more when the meal contained little or no protein.

In between times I snack on dry oatcakes (much nicer than they sound). I drink only water.

I've just got the following, but am not sure when best to take them. Don't yet know if I can tolerate them either, often I can't:

Krill oil 500mg

5-htp with l-tryptophan 400 mg

I also have vitamin C in a couple of forms, which I feel sure I should be taking, but I find it very hard to tolerate.


Edit: To try to be super clear, I'm not after advice about which supplements to take. I've already had plenty of that. It's when in the day it's best to take them and in what combinations.

I live in Seattle, which seems to have good water quality, but am curious about doing an experiment on myself to try something ""better"" for the next month or so and see if I notice any difference. I'm drinking 60-100 oz of water a day - my only minor complaint with my tap water is that it has a faint chlorine smell.

* What filtering or treating have you done to your water that you'd recommend? Has it had any noticeable health effects? [This study](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.81.6.703) indicates that filtering water vs tap alone may prevent 35% of GI illnesses.  

* Has anyone tried Alkaline or Kangen water and noticed benefits?  [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4906185/) indicates it could increase longevity in mice, but found no difference from examining their organs after study - unclear mechanism and may not generalize to humans.  Many proposed mechanisms on how alkaline water would benefit the body are scientifically implausible.

* Reverse Osmosis can remove both harmful and beneficial salts, but from what I've read, good diet and/or a multivitamin will provide plenty of beneficial salts.  Has anyone noticed a benefit or harm from adding a reverse osmosis filter on their tap water?

* Has anyone noticed a benefit from using filters that specifically target fluoride, chloramine and chromium?  I've found many threads saying ""fluoride doesn't cause any harm"" but none from people who have actually tried filtering it.  

* Does anyone add minerals or other dilute supplements to their daily drinking water, and have noticed positive results?

Common wisdom seems to be that tap water is ""good enough"", but I wonder if there is a better water, and what that might be. There is lots of woo and arguments-against-woo, so hard to find plausible personal accounts of benefits. Particularly interested in anecdotal personal experiences that indicate if any of these has a perceptible benefit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to drink more water, and the fluoride thread on this sub got me interested in water quality. I live in Seattle, which seems to have good water quality, but am curious about doing an experiment on myself to try something &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; for the next month or so and see if I notice any difference. I&amp;#39;m drinking 60-100 oz of water a day - my only minor complaint with my tap water is that it has a faint chlorine smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What filtering or treating have you done to your water that you&amp;#39;d recommend? Has it had any noticeable health effects? &lt;a href=""https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.81.6.703""&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; indicates that filtering water vs tap alone may prevent 35% of GI illnesses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried Alkaline or Kangen water and noticed benefits?  &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4906185/""&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; indicates it could increase longevity in mice, but found no difference from examining their organs after study - unclear mechanism and may not generalize to humans.  Many proposed mechanisms on how alkaline water would benefit the body are scientifically implausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reverse Osmosis can remove both harmful and beneficial salts, but from what I&amp;#39;ve read, good diet and/or a multivitamin will provide plenty of beneficial salts.  Has anyone noticed a benefit or harm from adding a reverse osmosis filter on their tap water?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone noticed a benefit from using filters that specifically target fluoride, chloramine and chromium?  I&amp;#39;ve found many threads saying &amp;quot;fluoride doesn&amp;#39;t cause any harm&amp;quot; but none from people who have actually tried filtering it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone add minerals or other dilute supplements to their daily drinking water, and have noticed positive results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm interested in the science of human aging. I've seen many interesting studies such as those which involve high dose vitamins like D or C in different scenarios (refusing chemotherapy, lifespan in animals). Then there are those which suggest butyrates produced by the gut can protect against M.S there are too many to list here. 

Vitamin K2 is also a microbially derived compound. K1 from healthful foods like kale. K2 is being studied now to be of importance for protecting against cancers, CKD, and helpful for processing  vitamin D3 in higher doses. Vitamin E on the other hand is thought to be dangerous at high doses for longer periods of time. It may be possible that this is due to its antagonistic effect on vitamin K2.

Today I was reading on a study involving vitamin E and asthma and this was striking:  ""In unpublished studies from our research group, lung inflammation in response to OVA was also reduced by administration of α-tocopherol through the diet and elevated by administration of γ-tocopherol through the diet, using a diets supplemented with 250 mg α- or γ-tocopherol /kg diet.""

So someone 100 kgs would take 250*100=25000/100=25g in this scenario. 400iu is about 0.6mg, so if you take 4 400iu pills you're just under 1 gram. So let me think like 100 of those shoprite vitamin E capsules a day. Now it would be extremely dangerous, but I've never encountered anything like this and I wanted to back it up online.

I had started getting panic attacks. Read to try magnesium and I did. Boom. Anxiety mostly gone surprisingly. Took magnesium in a high dose for 2 years at like 650mg a day. Taking calcium too I think in milk (cashew milk so it was added).

Magnesium started giving me adverse effects so I stopped taking it. No problem, I wasn’t having anxiety anymore. Fast forward to now. It’s been a year or two. I noticed that calcium and magnesium both affected me in weird ways. I know they balance each other out. They both caused me different types of anxiety when I took either. 

Now, I’m athletic but started taking a BJJ class lately. So I lift 3x a week, BJJ 3-4x a week for 2 hours each, and also surf a lot. 

I’m very active and started getting muscle twitches and cramps. I knew something was up. Before t was my magnesium so I tried supplementing again to stop the twitches. This just made me get anxiety and panic. I was down for a few days and lost libido. Anxiety and negative thoughts. 

I thought maybe it’s my calcium and I drank some. I picked myself up and did feel better actually. It worked. This was earlier this week. Well today I got another twitch. I drank some milk from the bottle. 10 minutes my twitch went away. 20-30 minutes later. Bad panic attack. Heart racing. I honestly felt “manic” in a way which is prob just the anxiety. I was getting a ton of work done, making calls before I started getting anxious and all these feelings. I got hyperhydrosis and just a lot of physical symptoms. Shaking bad.

I got some magnesium and took some. Now I’m in bed and feel A LOT better. 


Wtf is wrong with me? I honestly always felt a difference with calcium and magnesium, don’t know why. The weeks during BJJ and even before. I just didn’t take milk or magnesium and felt fine. It wasn’t until I started getting muscle twitches that I decided to start getting more of those in me. 

What do you guys recommend me doing? A lot of people say just supplement magnesium, but it feels like I need a perfect balance? 

Before this recently, I don’t get panic attacks a lot. It seems it only happens when I’m low in calcium or magnesium or oversupplemented one. My anxiety is like 5-10% and not that bad.


What can I do? ALSO, Vitamin D (when ever I’ve tried taking a D3 supplement, has haven me anxiety). Though I’ve only taken it like 5 times maybe because each time I get the same kind of anxiety I do when too much calcium or magnesium.


Edit: going to talk to a doctor. In the meantime. I’m going to lay off any supplements and keep training. Will get a bit of calcium from natural sources (instead of almond milk which has added calcium), so dairy.

I just bought some Ginkgo to take it in combination with Bacopa and Nigella sativa (Ginkgo + Bacopa for memory and Nigella sativa for mood).

But when I look at dosage recommandations on the internet I see people talking about 120mg, 240mg and so on. But is it leaf? extract? On my bottle there is written : Ginkgo Leaf 500mg per serving, Ginkgo leaf extract 74mg per serving \*

I'm going to start Alpha GPC (NOW 300mg) for brain fog/focus issues and I was wondering which supps I could pair with it to enhance its mechanism of action.

Reading here and on Longecity, I've seen that Alpha GPC is often taken with fish oil, B complex and uridine. Can you confirm or it'd be better to take a-GPC alone? I was thinking that maybe I could take **spirulina** or **brewer's yeast**\*,\* which are a natural source of B vitamins and also uridine.

Is **phosphatidylserine** required as well when supplementing Alpha GPC?

&lt;p&gt;Kratom: only red borneo, all other kratom strains will interfere with sleep and make it hard to fall asleep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kava: is ok, nothing too special, very mild at best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agmatine: awesome! falling asleep is definitely boosted, dreams are also significantly improved&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valerian: if i had to chose one winner out of this list, it would definitely be Valerian, i sometimes take a high dose extract of Valerian root and its safe to say, it ALWAYS is a godsend for sleep duration, falling asleep, sleep quality etc., waking up after one night with valerian is accompanied by fresh energy, positive mood and a feeling of being new born, so yeah definitely recommended&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any input, new supplements and add-ons to my list are highly appreciated! Cheers and good night! :)&lt;/p&gt;

Mostly just the gym side of the spectrum but have recently been exploring the other categories offered. In addition, I have also began a job in the supplement industry for a national chain. My concerns, which admittedly are not exactly new ones, are beginning to overwhelm me given my new perspective into the industry (sheer amount of products available) and my own personal needs. The particular concern being, as implied by the title, are the transparency and authenticity of supplement lables per company and per product. I have found numerous resources for dosage suggestions, general function of these ingredients, and so forth (shout out to [examine.com](https://examine.com) and most recently PubMed and its databases). However, I find myself to be more and more skeptical as time goes on. I can know that I need, for instance, 2g of EPA per day to meet my needs but what I can't know is if the particular supplement I'm taking actually delivers this amount despite what the label proclaims.

So, what I'm really looking for is a site or database that has publicly available third party testing for label integrity. I'm not above paying a fee as long as its reasonable but, of course, would prefer the information for free. Is there such a site? Am I just being dramatic and are most labels true? Any and all help is appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been taking supplements for the better part of a decade now, off and on. Mostly just the gym side of the spectrum but have recently been exploring the other categories offered. In addition, I have also began a job in the supplement industry for a national chain. My concerns, which admittedly are not exactly new ones, are beginning to overwhelm me given my new perspective into the industry (sheer amount of products available) and my own personal needs. The particular concern being, as implied by the title, are the transparency and authenticity of supplement lables per company and per product. I have found numerous resources for dosage suggestions, general function of these ingredients, and so forth (shout out to &lt;a href=""https://examine.com""&gt;examine.com&lt;/a&gt; and most recently PubMed and its databases). However, I find myself to be more and more skeptical as time goes on. I can know that I need, for instance, 2g of EPA per day to meet my needs but what I can&amp;#39;t know is if the particular supplement I&amp;#39;m taking actually delivers this amount despite what the label proclaims. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm a journalist who works at Consumer Reports currently working on a story about supplements. If possible, I'd love to be able to include some perspective from people who regularly take supplements (especially herbal/botanical products)--if you've experienced benefits related to these, I'd love to know; if you've had to stop taking them for some reason, I'd be curious about that too.

I have a lot of questions about how much evidence supports the use of various popular supplements that come through in the story, but I'll treat anyone's experience with respect. I wanted to ask about people's experiences here because I've been browsing posts and most people commenting seem to have reasonable expectations for what products can or can't do and there are a lot of helpful, evidence-backed discussions.

Interested in talking? Shoot me a PM (feel free to comment too, I just can't use reddit comments for a story). For me to include your thoughts, I'd need you to go on the record with your name and some basic biographical details (age, what you do, why you take the supplements you do), and it's possible a fact-checker would want to follow up with you to confirm details. I would not link your real name to your reddit username.

Mods, I don't think this violates any policies, but if it does I apologize (and of course remove it as I'm sure you would)! I'd just like to be able to include some perspective in the story from people who take supplements, not just academics/doctors.

I have taken it off and on for years but only recently realized it was causing this reaction as the last several years have been spent figuring out some food intolerances (which tend to be harder to pinpoint than allergies). 

I take it on and off because I don’t think it is healthy to supplement full time. So I take it for a few weeks, then I stop until i feel i need it again. I can usually tell when i need it because I start having restless legs and I get calve cramps. Once I take it they stop. 

Recently, I was on an off period and started getting symptoms again. I had been feeling good otherwise. Within two days I started having a reaction. I searched online and came across some articles that said it’s possible to have allergic reactions to Magnesium when it is supplemented. So I think that is what is happening. 

But I need to supplement somehow or I get these cramps and my legs feel weak (and I kick my husband at night!).

I tried one of those sports effervescent drink tablets for a week and it seemed alright but I don’t know how healthy those are. Also there is very little Magnesium in them so I’m not sure if I would be able to take them on and off or if I would have to be supplementing with them full time. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? I am wondering about suggestions of supplement types or specific products. I don’t know too much about this stuff so I don’t want to waste money just guessing. Also I am interested in people’s opinions about the effervescent tablets. 

Thank you!

I've been off the supplement train for the past year or so, (sometimes ya just get tired of it all :) ),

I'm looking to set up a supplement regime that makes sense for my situation, and honestly per usual it's incredibly daunting.

I'm going to take the more standard supplements which i find are atypical for age, condition and bloodwork (Glucosamin/Chondroitin,/MSM and D3 and Fish OiL).

What I'm looking to do is try to figure out what I should do in regards to Elysium (I have a backlog of it), PQQ,  Resveratrol , Metformin,  MNM (in lieu of Elysium), etc.

I know that a lot of these are nebulous as to their actual impacts, but I'm ok with taking a little bit of a chance and hoping.

Also it seems like it's necessary to manage and NAD+ precursor things outside ot workout days from what I've read/heard.

Any ""concise simple"" suggestions/plans?   

I'd like to stay away from reading 15 articles and a 1000 word essay on the biochemistry of it all.

Also I 100% know that a lot is speculation and don't expect anyone to ""know the truth"".

My interest in this is very practical - I don't have a lot of interest in the details beyond hearing the occasional Rhonda Patrick or David Sinclair podcast interview.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that is not insultive to anyone here.  Just wanted to layout where I am coming from and what will help me.

Sincerely thank you for any input.  I'm excited about so many hopeful things - but also overwhelmed.

Help With IP6 Iron Chelation Safety

[https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/67219-help-with-ip6-iron-chelation-safety/](https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/67219-help-with-ip6-iron-chelation-safety/)

The beauty of IP6 is that it spares important minerals like potassium and sodium, while aggressively snapping up potent hydroxyl generators like free/labile/serum iron and copper. Protein bound minerals (calcium in bone and iron in hemoglobin) are also spared.

Literature describes IP6 as a chelator of ""divalent"" metals (copper, zinc, lead, manganese, iron, cadmium, magnesium, calcium and arsenic), but other texts also describe IP6 as a good chelator of uranium

Theres also this source:

[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13aa/f40b48f8e52279249a60fb7a47566ec395a1.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13aa/f40b48f8e52279249a60fb7a47566ec395a1.pdf)

IP6 phytic acid is a selective mineral chelator that attaches to high valence metallic minerals such as copper, iron, mercury, lead, cadmium, but not to nonmetallic electrolyte minerals such as sodium, potassium and magnesium.

Apparently it claims phytic acid binds to any free iron or other minerals (even heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium) in the blood, which are then eliminated through the kidneys. Phytic acid removes only excess or unbound minerals, not mineral ions already attached to proteins.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just thought some of you might be interested in this.Since I know personally speaking that heavy metal detoxification can be such a challenge, specifically of Mercury. With all the dangers of NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) and ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid) of sending mercury to the wrong places in your body causing damage as it attaches itself where it shouldn't. With the most dangerous of all places being brain, since theres too much of a body burden already, unbounded mercury could cause chaos and wreak havoc. So It would be very relieving to know theres such a chelator as IP-6 that binds and attaches so strongly all the way till it's excreted.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in Heavy metal detoxification, IP-6 seems to be a very safe chelation agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of IP6 is that it spares important minerals like potassium and sodium, while aggressively snapping up potent hydroxyl generators like free/labile/serum iron and copper. Protein bound minerals (calcium in bone and iron in hemoglobin) are also spared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature describes IP6 as a chelator of &amp;quot;divalent&amp;quot; metals (copper, zinc, lead, manganese, iron, cadmium, magnesium, calcium and arsenic), but other texts also describe IP6 as a good chelator of uranium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres also this source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13aa/f40b48f8e52279249a60fb7a47566ec395a1.pdf""&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13aa/f40b48f8e52279249a60fb7a47566ec395a1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP6 phytic acid is a selective mineral chelator that attaches to high valence metallic minerals such as copper, iron, mercury, lead, cadmium, but not to nonmetallic electrolyte minerals such as sodium, potassium and magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently it claims phytic acid binds to any free iron or other minerals (even heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium) in the blood, which are then eliminated through the kidneys. Phytic acid removes only excess or unbound minerals, not mineral ions already attached to proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thought some of you might be interested in this.Since I know personally speaking that heavy metal detoxification can be such a challenge, specifically of Mercury. With all the dangers of NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) and ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid) of sending mercury to the wrong places in your body causing damage as it attaches itself where it shouldn&amp;#39;t. With the most dangerous of all places being brain, since theres too much of a body burden already, unbounded mercury could cause chaos and wreak havoc. So It would be very relieving to know theres such a chelator as IP-6 that binds and attaches so strongly all the way till it&amp;#39;s excreted.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been supplementing with folinic acid as I have the genetic mutation that makes one deficient, been on it for about 3 weeks, then a few days ago I added in vitamin B12 and was hit with horrific insomnia, anxiety, and muscle twitching.  Since then I've been trying to treat it so I can continue to reap the benefits of my regimen, one thing I tried helped a bit, valerian root, but more importantly, potassium.

Apparently what can happen when you are B12 deficient, there aren't enough proper red blood cells.  Then when you take a high dose of B12 (I take 1,000 mcg), the body puts it to work and tries to make more red blood cells rapidly, which depletes its stores of potassium, resulting in hypokalemia and its symptoms, which can include insomnia, anxiety, and twitching.

I gathered this info reading various posts on the wonderful world wide web that had the same problems with B12, and this solved it for them.  According to one post I read, the need to supplement potassium with the B12 is only temporary, that the side effects will go away once the rapid use of potassium is completed.  I don't know how long that will take, we shall see.  Anyways, I put a ? at the end of my post title as I've only started the B12 three days ago (also when the symptoms started) and I only just started the potassium today, so while the side effects are gone, it's too soon to say with certainty this will continue to work.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all.

Hi there,

Not sure if this is the correct place to ask this.

I've had a long lasting UTI infection which after doing some research, I believe is due to the bacteria hiding in biofilm.

I'm taking NAC twice a day due to its ability to destroy biofilm, but haven't been able to find how long I should continue to take it in any of the studies I've read.

If anyone has any experience with this, it would be great to understand how this worked for you.

Thanks!

(I'm not asking for medical advise, I'm currently receiving that from a doctor. But just want to understand how this has worked for others)

Edit: I’m now resistant or allergic to the main antibiotics which treat this type of infection. Which is why I’m taking it into my own hands, I am still on antibiotics however and will continue to take doctors advise! :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm pretty new to this subreddit, but I really like the idea of taking supplements (&amp; regular exercise &amp; good diet) instead of medication. I am currently on two antidepressants, Zoloft (50mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg). They have been working pretty good for about a year now, but have had some decent side effects (ruined short term memory, very shaky hands, trouble expressing emotion, etc).

I have been able to resume a fairly normal lifestyle, and have formed a workout routine and diet. I felt like this is a good time to try to taper off the medication, and my doctor has agreed to let me try (he was hesitant at first - he would prefer to have me stay on medication long term). He has formed a tapering timeline for me, which will take about 6 months to accomplish. If there are any major setbacks, I plan to go back onto medication and try again another time.

Sorry for the long winded explanation. I am curious to know if anyone else might have some experience tapering off of medication, and if they added any supplements to their diet that helped make this transition easier. 

Of course I want to be very careful - I do not want anything to interact with the medication I am on, and am looking for things that are safe to take long term.

  So I've done research into curcumin and according to examine.com and their sources curcumin is notable for pain relieving. When I went to look for actual products though the fun began (as some of you may already know). With all of these proprietary blends and marketing bs I am struggling to find a trustworthy product to purchase in Canada. 

&amp;nbsp;

  It is my understanding that what matters is the amount of curcuminoids in the product, not the tumeric root extract or whatever it is they claim to pump their numbers. At that, about 500mg of curcuminoids per serving seems to be the magic number, combined with 5mg of peperdine or some other piece that enhances the bio-availability of the curcuminoid.

&amp;nbsp;

  The product I'm looking at right now is Jarrow Formulas Curcumin 95. Is Jarrow reputable? And as well, it looks like the product is only curcumin, so I would need to get a peperdine supplement as well to go along with it correct?

I did my best to do my research. But what do you think?

\*\*The following is drawn from my own personal experience, and *should NOT be considered medical advice*.\*\*

Magnesium is a cofactor in *hundreds* of enzymatic processes in the body. I was once [magnesium deficient](https://hvmn.com/blog/supplements/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms-and-solutions) myself and found a tremendous amount of benefit since I started taking a supplement on a daily basis. 

**How much Magnesium to Take**

The RDA for magnesium is around 400mg, depending on age and gender. This is the minimal amount needed to ensure our body has enough magnesium to help support processes that utilize it. IMO, there’s no way to know if this is enough magnesium for you unless you’ve been tested. 

**Self-balancing test**

The body is pretty good at removing excess magnesium, so you generally will get rid of any excess without it building up. The way I have determined my dosage in the past was to start taking 1 magnesium pill per meal, each day. If I didn’t get loose or watery stools for **3** days, I upped the dosage to 2 pills per meal, per day. I continue this routine until I start getting GI distress. When this happens, I back off the previous dose that didn’t cause issues. It’s been my experience that cyclical infection such as parasites, fungus, and other nutrient-robbing conditions can sometimes necessitate the supplementation of more magnesium during periods of high activity. For example; you may find that a **3** pill per meal dose works well for the most part, but that it causes diarrhea on occasion. It’s a balancing act, and it pays to keep an attentive eye on how your body responds to any supplements you’re taking.

**Other Compounds**

Magnesium has been connected to proper mental function in several cases. Magnesium glycinate and other amino-acid chelates are typically associated with this type of use because they’ve demonstrated high-absorbability in oral dosing. B vitamins and other minerals such as boron have been implicated as being involved with absorbability of magnesium, though IMO convincing data is still pretty sparse. One notable exception is the active form of Vitamin B6 Pyridoxal \`5-phosphate (P5P) which has data suggesting it plays a role in ushering nutrients across cellular membranes. There are a lot of genetic considerations to make for Vitamin B compounds such as MTHFR mutations that affect how the body utilizes these compounds. TL;DR is that some genetic conditions necessitate the use of certain types of these compounds, or else you’ll be adding additional burden to your self. Check out the Know Your Genetics website for more information on that, and click around on anything from Dr. Amy Yasko. I believe it’s impossible for anyone other than a doctor, or someone with access to your testing data, to make an accurate recommendation for this kind of concern.

**Broad recommendations**

Pay close attention to the quality of the supplements you buy. Make sure you’re buying from brands whose products are products in NSF-registered GMP facilities and you feel confident have a robust quality assurance system in place. There are many such brands, often considered Practitioner Channel Brands which are generally regarded to be the highest quality products on the market. These are brands used and recommended by licensed professionals to provided therapeutic results to patients. Before considering *anything* I just said very seriously, please note that I am not a doctor and speak only from my own personal experience.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE QUESTION IS: Is it safe to continue taking them?

For example, my anxiety is the worst, so if I woke up and took some tryptophan with coffee around 7, if I took theanine at 9 would that give enough time to free up space so that a majority of the theanine would cross the BBB? What do you guys think? Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello internet comrades! So like many, I&amp;#39;ve had anxiety/depression/ mood issues since I was about 14. I&amp;#39;m 26 now and in pretty good shape. I&amp;#39;m about 6&amp;#39;3 and about 200 pounds, exercise regularly but not super intensely. I eat relatively healthy too, very little refined sugar, and mostly pescatarian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is about using amino acid supplements, specifically tryptophan, theanine, and tyrosine! If I wanted to take both, or even all three within a day, how long would I have to wait to space them out so as to not have them compete for space crossing the blood brain barrier? I can&amp;#39;t seem to find this information anywhere! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my anxiety is the worst, so if I woke up and took some tryptophan with coffee around 7, if I took theanine at 9 would that give enough time to free up space so that a majority of the theanine would cross the BBB? What do you guys think? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of context I’m 30 years old and work a mentally and to semi physical job as a construction superintendent. Due to the jobs high stress and cognitive demand, I find I start to burn out late morning to early afternoon depending on how many meetings and whatnot I have. Some mornings I feel defeated before I even start. These supplements have really improved every aspect of my job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any experiences with these supplements I’d love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

It's better now though I don't feel completely back (the cognitive is ok, the mood not yet).

I'm trying to understand what happened, if I can learn something useful for the next steps that would be nice.

Does someone have an idea?

The problem I'm facing is that most of the supplements advised for boosting methylation/glutathion production make me feel bad (choline and TMG make me depressed, Glycine/Collagen makes me very sleepy and gives me massive brainfog, I got a panic attack from liquid MethylB12...). When it comes to MTFHR there's a lot of opposing informations and phony stuff so it's a bit discouraging.

What I'm taking for a couple of months that works (or at least does nothing bad):

\- L-Theanine (with and without coffee)

\- KSM-66

\- Creatine

\- Vitamin C / D

\- Zinc

\- Magnesium Citrate

\- Molybdenum

\- B-Complex

\- L-Tyrosine/NALT/L-Phenylalanine (cycled)

\- ALCAR and L-Carnitine (not everyday)

\- Rhodiola

EDIT: Taurine

I have also a prescription for Ritalin XR (methylphenidate) 10mg, I'd like to get rid of it if I can that's why I'm experimenting with supplements (started at 80mg four years ago and lowered it progressively as I was getting more and more anxiety from it).

Other things: I have IBS, sleep apnea (treated with machine, no other sleep disorder detected).

Hello, so im thinking about stopping eating sugar, or at least TURN it down a lot. Im not in the USA so i hope i dont eat much sugar even as it is now, but still im thinking about cutting it out completely (slowly) or at least try to reduce it a lot. My question is- there are a lot of info online about cutting out eating sugar etc. what sugar can cause (acne, etc.) that it is not good for you etc.

My question is directly at YOU or someone you know (closely and can believe them) - what did cutting out eating sugar (or at least heavily turn down your daily sugar intake) brought you? Please answer only those who dont eat sugar at all or at very low dosages AND been doing so for a while (not just few days or a week or so). So the positives could kick in (i dont think they kick in right away). What was the change for you (positive (or negative?) ?

I've no experience with supplements.

My mother recently developed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and has been taking the pills in the link above.

They cost a pretty penny and she pays it. The person who first sold it to her (and one other close family friend) is another friend they met through their religious meetings (Church).

I recently found out about this and looked into it, but could not find info, but that may be due to my inexperience with these things, so have decided to ask around for various things.

Turns out this supplement has... different effects to different people? My mother with PSP said it cures her leg aches/pains... if she takes 6 pills at once every morning. (prescription says to take 2 a day, morning and afternoon)

For the family friend mentioned... it reduces strain on her knees and gives her more energy.

Also found out, from the family friend, who still believes it works and has seen info on it but cannot quote me the source off the top of her head, that their mutual church friend who sold/recommended it to them is also a member of the company producing/selling these pills...

These all add up to quite a lot of red flags for me, any thoughts?

I want to up to 600mg but it seems like a bunch to take at once. For reference I’m a 6’3” 235lbs male with almost no caffeine in the rest of my diet (no coffee, energy drinks, soda, or sweets)

Hello!

First I’m sorry that this question is being asked again. Yes I’ve searched and all the posts seem to be regarding coffee/energy drinks and the time frame for consumption throughout the day.

I’m curious as to the potential effects of taking 600mg of caffeine at once (3x200mg pills). 

I’ve been taking 400mg of caffeine as a pre workout for a couple of months now. It has never really given me an energy kick. I go to the gym bright and early (5:30am) and the caffeine gets the sleepiness to go away some but I never feel jittery or super energized. I’ve been wanting to step it up on my more intensive days (squat and deadlift) for a little extra pep in my step.

I don’t drink coffee, energy drinks, or soda. I do drink a lot of sweet tea being from the South but it’s rarely more than a glass every couple of days now. I haven’t experienced any negative side effects nor have I felt bad when I took a three week break from the pills recently. 

I’m a pretty large guy (6’3” 235lbs decent BMI) so I’m guessing my tolerance is higher than most. I just generally don’t like taking drugs (I don’t take any supplements other than caffeine) so I’m somewhat hesitant to step up to this. It seems like a lot. Are there any inherent risks or is it different for individuals?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: 400mg of caffeine for preworkout feels just “meh”.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a pretty large guy (6’3” 235lbs decent BMI) so I’m guessing my tolerance is higher than most. I just generally don’t like taking drugs (I don’t take any supplements other than caffeine) so I’m somewhat hesitant to step up to this. It seems like a lot. Are there any inherent risks or is it different for individuals?&lt;/p&gt;

From what I've learned on this sub, I should be taking supps for their anti inflammatory effect as well as to help speed healing along.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been given a list of foods to avoid in order to keep inflammation down and to assist my immune function.

But now I need a good healing stack. The anti inflammatory stuff I should have built up in my bloodstream BEFORE the surgery, ya?  So I should start taking them asap.

At times I can get like 3 hours of sleep in the night, and 8 hours on days I’m not working. I’m also a pretty light sleeper, whereby i will wake up once or twice in the night for no reason.

I've been training for years on and off, most of it more casually but I have been using protein powder shakes for a while back in the day. 

Now after over a year of not using it and going back to working out more intensely, I tried it again and had terrible stomach aches, this happened more than once.

I tried different combinations to see if my problem was milk which I don't consume often, drinking the shake based on milk or water still gave me stomach aches. the only way I could use that protein that didn't hurt my stomach was protein pancakes but that's not something I can manage and it loses the point of a protein shake.

for that matter I've been using Musclepharm's Combat powder, same product I used to take before. I didn't hear about any changes they made to the product over that time and I haven't got to use a different powder yet but I intend to.

I’ve been a car salesman since I was 18, and it’s a really tough job to keep a clean diet with. It’s doable, but it’s a lot of work. So I’ve basically been living off fast food and scavenging things here and there for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’d been feeling really lethargic, drained, tired, etc. My brain felt foggy and I’d developed a pretty somber mood. After a bad breakup I started running again (Up to like 6-7 miles a week now) and picked up a multivitamin at CVS because I’m trying to be an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, 4 weeks later and today it dawned on me that I feel great and have felt great for a couple weeks now! I’m joking around all the time at work, smiling at everything, feeling energized and alert even on days I’m working on low sleep. It’s just an overall quality feel. My default mood has switched from somber to pleasant and optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

I exercise daily, eat lean meats 9/10 times that I have meat, have decent vegetable intact (likely below average a bit), good fruit intake, and don’t eat very many processed foods. I don’t drink or smoke. I’m 30.

Now I got new supplements that supposedly support beard growth so I wanted to give them a shot. They contain Biotin which I read helped with beard growth. On further inspection, however, they also contain a lot of the vitamins and minerals that the other tablet contains and both boxes specify not to take more than the recommended daily dosis.

* Iodine (I think - translating here) [100%]

Taurine (almost daily, 0.5g)

Vitamin C (maybe 5g per week, usually 3g on my off day)

K2 is taken to prevent osteoporosis and arterial calcification when taking D3. Why? Because vitamin D can take calcium from your bones in your blood stream and can lead to too much calcium in the blood, hypercalcemia. But this does not happen at daily intake values, it happens at a rate base don your D3 serum levels.

 **If your D3 and calcium serum levels are normal, there should not be an immediate need for K2 supplementation.** Ask yourself this: is people who have normal D3 and calcium levels  (arguably most people) in danger of falling over from clogged arteries because they forgot their K2? You can see how silly the K2 hype can be. Granted, if you're just starting out supplementing, I am all for taking K2 from the get go just to be safe, instead of going months without it just to see what your D3 and calcium serum levels are without it.

""But won't D3 levels in the blood spike right after supplementing with it?"" No. Vitamin D levels takes a long time to build up. It does not ""spike"" as if you're taking it intravenously. To test, I've taking blood levels hours after D3 supplementation (5000 iu), the day after and a week without, with D3 and calcium levels being approximately at the same level.

However, there is some evidence that D3 supplementation alone without K2 can cause mild osteoporosis even at normal D3 and calcium serum levels. HOWEVER, this does not mean that the body then have no idea what to do with the calcium and that it starts to lump up in your veins. This happens only if the calcium levels in your blood is at hyperglycemia levels: remember, calcium drawn from your bones and into your blood stream due to osteoporosis simply adds to the serum calcium levels you already have present. But this alone, preventing osteoporosis, can be an argument for taking K2. But that you need it to prevent arterial calcification when you're within normal range is simply untrue.

**TLDR: I love that this sub is on the safety first-line, but there is a lot of scare mongering going around. If your blood levels are normal after extensive period of D3 supplementation, you're not in danger.

Is the Aspirin necessary for a functional stack or is it preference? Doing a google search shows me that it basically prolongs the effects of the E&amp;C. I know that it should be my decision but I’d like to hear opinions.

Is there a specific time/way to cycle EC(A)? Is cycling even necessary? Or how to make sure I’m healthy on the stack without doing long term damage to my system.

Last, what about weaning off? Is this one of those things similar to certain medications that you can’t stop cold turkey or is that part of the cycle?

There are so many articles and so much research behind the benefits such as promoting lean body mass/strength and improving on muscular endurance without gaining any fat mass. So it's clear it does have a significant impact on the body and it's ability to become stronger.

Articles such as [this](https://creaturecreatine.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/if-creatine-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-banned-in-professional-sports/) which try to explain are pointless because they fail to mention steroids like testosterone are also naturally occurring in the body, albeit in varying amounts, but surely creatine must also vary between individuals - therefore in order to overcome a natural barrier of having lower creatine they then supplement it into their diet in order to perform better?

On [this](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/17/content_315489.htm) article it describes  ""If you think of an athlete's body as being like a car, things like carbohydrate or creatine are like changing the oil"" whilst  ""On the other hand, anabolic steroids are like changing the architecture of the engine - the muscle."" - but this implies creatine does not an effect on changing the muscle mass in the body which is incorrect?

It's clear there are many positives to Creatine supplementation and also negatives if not taken properly or in too larger doses, but does it not have effects that produces similar result to substances which are  banned, and therefore I cannot understand why it is not banned within professional sports.

&lt;p&gt;Articles such as &lt;a href=""https://creaturecreatine.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/if-creatine-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-banned-in-professional-sports/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which try to explain are pointless because they fail to mention steroids like testosterone are also naturally occurring in the body, albeit in varying amounts, but surely creatine must also vary between individuals - therefore in order to overcome a natural barrier of having lower creatine they then supplement it into their diet in order to perform better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/17/content_315489.htm""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article it describes  &amp;quot;If you think of an athlete&amp;#39;s body as being like a car, things like carbohydrate or creatine are like changing the oil&amp;quot; whilst  &amp;quot;On the other hand, anabolic steroids are like changing the architecture of the engine - the muscle.&amp;quot; - but this implies creatine does not an effect on changing the muscle mass in the body which is incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear there are many positives to Creatine supplementation and also negatives if not taken properly or in too larger doses, but does it not have effects that produces similar result to substances which are  banned, and therefore I cannot understand why it is not banned within professional sports.&lt;/p&gt;

I bought a beef gelatin powder (200 bloom guaranteed) and the package said to just mix 1-2 tsps with water, leave it for at least an hour and drink it like it is. Now I know gelatin only &amp;#39;swells up&amp;#39; in cold water and dissolves in hot (but not boiling) water (up to 60C degrees/140 F, because it loses its properties if you warm it up higher). Should I consume it like it says on the packaging, dissolved and warmed up or make a cold jello? What&amp;#39;s the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

Do anyone have any experience with suffering from depression before and also suffering from a lack of vitamin D? Or any experiences with vitamin D in general. I'm not looking to see if it'll completely change the way I feel, but any little benefits or improvement is still a benefit to me.

Although I do not have much expectations for things to work, due to past experiences with trying nootropics and supplements and stuff. But again, any benefit is a benefit indeed.

Haven't posted here in a while but i've been lurking.

I just wanted to share my experience supplementing more bioavailable forms of B12, B9, Boron and especially Magnesium.

I noticed a drastic change when switching from magnesium oxide to magnesium l-threonate for instance. The L-threonate form **completely cured** my anxiety and unnecessary stress / worrying! I thought it was bizarre how I could be so deficient in something so simple like an electrolyte.

Diving into this, I found that a lot of stimulants like coffee and especially things like amphetamines DEPLETE magnesium. I believe coffee actually inhibits the absorption of magnesium in the intestines.

I wrote up a small post describing my experience with other supplements as well if you are interested, you can read it here: [https://vivacityandvigor.com/part-3-of-5-supplementing-bioavailable-forms-of-vitamins-electrolytes-minerals/](https://vivacityandvigor.com/part-3-of-5-supplementing-bioavailable-forms-of-vitamins-electrolytes-minerals/)

I hope this doesn't break any of the rules of this subreddit; if it does, please let me know and I will take it down!

Other than that, what supplements have you found to work better when chelated to another amino acid for enhanced bioavailability? I know methylated supplements like methylcobalamin are a lot better as well.

Recently, I've been looking for a **good form** of zinc to supplement along with copper as well. My goal is to optimize testosterone synthesis for mood, energy and gym gains. Any recommendations?

I am a 20 year old male, 140 lbs and I’m 6’0. My main symptoms have been constant anxiety, severe fatigue, mood swings, depression and muscle/joint weakness. 

So, I recently got a full blood test done at my doctor’s office and I’m gonna mention anything that needs work/deficiencies, etc: 

*My B-12 level was at 1617 (the normal range is 200-950, but my doctor skimmed past that one and didn’t say anything about it) 

*My cholesterol was high and I was just recommended to eat a diet high in soluble fiber. And I’m taking 1,000 mg of Niacin a day to help with that. 

*Vitamin D was low (26) and I was prescribed with 50,000 IU (softgel) twice a week.

*And finally, I found out I was blessed with the good ole MTHFR Mutation, C677T. I was prescribed with L-Methyl Folate (Deplin) once a day. 

Now, I’ll say that it’s been almost a week of me taking L-Methyl Folate and I almost feel worse than when I started. Is this normal? It feels like my fatigue has only started to increase and my mood is extremely affected. 

To recap: I’m taking 1 Methyl Folate (15 mg) tablet a day, 2 Vitamin D-3 (50,000 IU) softgel’s a week, 1,000 mg of Niacin a day. And because I found out about Vitamin K and Vitamin D working together, I recently got a 100 mcg K-2 supplement.

Wanted to share my experience for you guys.
I have taken various vitamins, minerals and whatnot on and off for years. I've never responded so noticeably to anything before.
I have been struggling a lot lately with mental health. I am a woman and my hormones did have something to do with it, but only an exacerbation of what was already there. I have always had anxiety but developed depression maybe 6 months ago after some significant trauma.
I did a lot of mental processing and work, psychologists and self inquiry and all that, which helped to a degree, but I felt the dark cloud of depression hanging over me. My thoughts were very negative, I often described it as feeling like all the happiness and goodness has been drained out of everything. I felt suicidal often, had no will or interest in doing anything.
About a month ago I had the financial ability to invest in some supplements, this is what I've been taking (I have put a star next to what I feel might have helped my mental health):

- Collagen powder
- Calcium citrate (with magnesium oxide)
- B-complex *
- Vitamin D3 *
- Probiotic
- Digestive enzyme
- Vitamin C 
- L-theanine (only taken when I feel anxious or have coffee jitters, seems to take the edge off)

How I feel now:
Amazing! Happy! I feel so much lighter, easily smiling, laughing, more physical energy, less physical pain (I have fibromyalgia like symptoms).
I have not had a mood swing, depressive episode, or anything since starting this. Beforehand it was almost every day. When something triggers me now, I might have a little cry or anxiety, but I just dont fall into the hole of depressive suicidal hopelessness, which beforehand was so strong I barely had any control over being pulled deeply into an emotional state. Everyone around me has noticed a difference. My skin is clearer too. I used to have particularly bad morning depression and anxiety, waking up with dread, now I wake up excited for the day!
My anxiety in general hasn't changed heaps, i have a super sensitive nervous system, I am okay with this for now. The depression was much more unbearable.

So amazing to feel this so strongly! 
I have never taken D3 or B complex before, It must be one or both of these. I usually get a lot of sunshine so I didn't think D3 was necessary, but after some research I thought I should try anyway.

As some of you may have read in other posts, I've been taking supplemental vitamin D3 to correct a deficiency measured at \~13 ng/mL.  It is recommended to supplement magnesium and vitamin K2 with it to help it absorb best, function better, and prevent excess calcium in the blood to avoid potential organ and blood vessel damage from potential hypercalcemia.  However, which form of vitamin K2 (MK-4 or MK-7) is best?

The first thing to look at is the different half lives.  The half life of MK7 according to one source I read is about 3.5 days, and since it takes 5 half lives of a substance to achieve steady state in the blood, if you were to take the same amount of vitamin K2 MK7 every day, it would take about 17.5 days to achieve steady state (a system that is in a steady state remains constant over time, but that constant state requires continual work.  In this example, the system being kept at a constant is the blood level of vitamin K, and the continual work being done is the daily administration of the vitamin.)

So the good thing about the half life of K2 MK7 is that you only need to take it once per day, but the drawback is that it takes 17.5 days to achieve steady blood levels of it.  I don't know if you can take a loading dose of MK7 initially to speed this up or not, if it is safe or not ( In pharmocokinetics, a loading dose is an initial higher dose of a drug that may be given at the beginning of a course of treatment before dropping down to a lower maintenance dose).

MK4 on the other hand has a half life of only 1 - 2 hours according to one source I read, so you would need to supplement it 3 times a day to keep up steady blood levels.  The good news is that if you get side effects from it or need to stop for whatever reason, you won't be stuck with it for very long as you might with MK7.

Now on to the oral bioavailability of MK4.  According to the following study, ""\[oral administration of\] MK-4 was not detectable in the serum of all subjects at any time point. Consecutive administration of MK-4 (60 μg; 135 nmol) or MK-7 (60 μg; 92 nmol) for 7 days demonstrated that MK-4 supplementation did not increase serum MK-4 levels.""  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502319/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502319/)

However, according to the following study, "" In a randomized study in 241 postmenopausal women, a supplement of 45 mg vitamin K2(MK-4, menaquinone-4) over a period of 24 months led to a significant rise in carboxylated osteocalcin (cOC) and a significantly reduced fracture rate compared with the control group."" This would indicate that it is getting absorbed, but I can't seem to find what route they used to administer it, was it given orally?    Also, the dose was 45 mg, I don't know what is typical in a supplement, but the bottle I have is only 5 mg per capsule.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580041/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580041/)

In the following article, they examined multiple studies that found that MK7 had far superior oral bioavailability than MK4, exclaiming that taking oral MK7 raised blood level of MK4 higher than if one supplemented actual oral MK4 itself  [https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2012/11/15/Vitamin-K2-Study-unlocks-which-forms-have-higher-bioavailability](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2012/11/15/Vitamin-K2-Study-unlocks-which-forms-have-higher-bioavailability)

In conclusion, the data seems to indicate that oral MK7 is superior to oral MK4, although you would have to take it for weeks for the MK7 to build up to a steady state in the body.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again.

Any tips? I feel like whatever shows up on my face is a side effect of something that's happening inside so it makes me really sad not knowing how to fix it...

He gave fat burners and his pre workout to me. The first week I took them, I had so much energy and lifting more than I would normally.

Then the ""problems"" started to lurk, I took them again after my rest day, about 50 minutes in I suddenly felt shortness of breath, heart throbbing and felt like I was on the verge of passing out. I actually thought I was having a heart attack. This effect lasted the entire day, couldn't sleep and was worried for my life. I went to the doctors while still under the aftermath effect. My heart rate was normal and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but I still felt wild and not feeling good. The doctor said it would have been my adrenaline pumping to stop me from passing out and thats why I don't feel too well.

I asked my mate if it was the pre workout and he said it doesn't have much caffeine in. I dismissed it and went back to the gym 3-4 days after the episode (I was still under the effect even 2 days after). I was convinced it was just a panic attack and it was very hot that day so I thought that was the cause. So after the effects worn off I then took half a scoop this time, and it set me off, almost instantly, like 15 minutes after taking it. I was at the gym shaking, heart pounding and shortness of breath kicked in again.

This effect aside from the heart pounding is still giving me problems 3 WEEKS after. I've not been in the gym since, I struggle to sleep every night because I feel like I'm not getting enough air in me, I panic a bit and remind myself of the breathing techniques which do help. But its constant. I went for a run today, to see if it would improve my breathing and at least being a bit active. I felt like shit about 10 minutes of running, heart racing and shortness of breath again. Only lasted for 20 minutes. I felt better for the rest of the day. Shortness of breath does seem to get noticeably worse when lying down to sleep for some reason. It has got better over the course of three weeks, my appetite has somewhat returned but the shortness of breath still persists which worries me.

I've ditched pre workout and those fat burners, not taking them again. I lost too much for the ""benefits"" and they don't seem to benefit me any longer. I can barely drink tea without it making my heart race now. I feel like my body overreacted to the amount of caffeine I've had and now maybe developed an intolerance to the caffeine?

I'm going for another doc appointments, I will bring up the supplements I've been taking as I wasn't aware that fat burners had so much caffeine in. Has anyone taken both? Did you get any side effects and how long did they last?

I'm worried its affected me in a way I won't be able to train as hard or effectively as I once have. I know caffeine takes like 5 hours to half in your system. I still don't understand why the problems still lurk.

It has got better over the course of three weeks, my appetite has somewhat returned but the shortness of breath still persists which worries me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve ditched pre workout and those fat burners, not taking them again. I lost too much for the &amp;quot;benefits&amp;quot; and they don&amp;#39;t seem to benefit me any longer. I can barely drink tea without it making my heart race now. I feel like my body overreacted to the amount of caffeine I&amp;#39;ve had and now maybe developed an intolerance to the caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going for another doc appointments, I will bring up the supplements I&amp;#39;ve been taking as I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that fat burners had so much caffeine in. Has anyone taken both? Did you get any side effects and how long did they last?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried its affected me in a way I won&amp;#39;t be able to train as hard or effectively as I once have. I know caffeine takes like 5 hours to half in your system. I still don&amp;#39;t understand why the problems still lurk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise if this isn&amp;#39;t the right sub reddit to post but figured it&amp;#39;d be interesting and maybe shed some light for me. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

These are 550mg with 90mg of potassium. I want to know how much is too much, because I'd like to get my potassium back into range quickly. (I tested 3.3, with 3.6 being the low end of the range. This is the same as it tested the last time it dropped low.)

The long story: I'm on blood pressure medication that conserves potassium, but it's paired with a diuretic that's doing too good a job flushing it out. This is the second time in two years my potassium has tested low. The previous time, I got it back up with a short-term high-dose supplement prescribed by my doctor, but my regular doctor won't be able to see me for a few weeks and the one I just saw hasn't prescribed anything of the sort, so I'm stuck with OTC and dietary options. When I did take the high-dose supplements, I went back up to like 3.9, but apparently I didn't stay there because a year and half later, I'm down again.

The reason this is hugely important to me is that this appears to have caused a major inflammatory condition, either all on its own or by triggering some kind of undiagnosed autoimmune thing. A year and a half ago I had the same condition and it was right around the time the potassium tested low, and I think I was actually recovering from the inflammation when I started supplements. For the past six weeks I've been going through the same thing, but worse, and I'm hoping that getting the potassium back into range will help.

From what I've been reading, 4700mg is the RDA. I don't know if the potassium gluconate would only count 90mg toward that total, or 550, but either way it doesn't seem like enough.

I made a post a few weeks ago about Vitamin D3 and how I was failing at supplementing it due to experiencing powerful fatigue and brain fog.  I tried combining it with both magnesium and vitamin K2 to fix this problem, and while I had success at getting rid of the anxiety/akathisia it gave me, I was unable to get rid of the fatigue/brain fog.  Until now.

I now suspect that part of my initial negative reaction to even merely 1,000 iu of vitamin D3 is due to something that may fly under the radar of those others who experience this problem as I did and have been searching for an answer - infectious pathogens.  And I have evidence of which type of pathogen may be responsible in my particular circumstances; tick pathogens.  About 5 - 7 years ago I contracted lyme disease from a tick bite.  Blood tests for this illness are notoriously unreliable, but I was 'lucky' enough to have the telltale sign of lyme infection, I developed a bullseye rash at the site of the bite shortly after it occurred.  That specific type of rash combined with the circumstances behind it are practically irrefutable proof of a lyme infection.  My GP diagnosed it, and though she gave me the standard week or two of oral antibiotics, there are many examples of the existence of chronic lyme infection surviving in the body despite the initial short-term treatment.  There is also evidence that lyme can be one contributor to vitamin D deficiency, possibly as a defense mechanism of the pathogen (I have also been bitten by ticks on other occasions, as recently as a year ago, though no rash developed).

After reading up on this, I decided to try supplementing with monolaurin, which is a substance found in smallish amounts in breast milk, and is synthesized in much higher dosage and concentration from lauric acid, which comes from coconut oil.  Monolaurin is a powerful pathogen killer that attacks the protective biofilm that bacteria shield themselves with.  Monolaurin helps the body kill not just bacteria, but also viruses and fungi.  One other related use of monolaurin besides killing pathogens is that it helps people with chronic fatigue syndrome.

I started taking it a week ago, and after a couple days it started making me more fatigued, as well as nauseous, and depressed.  This may have been a Herxheimer reaction, which is when a substance  kills a large amount of pathogens and they spill their cellular contents into the blood stream in such high amounts that they temporarily overwhelm the body's ability to clean this waste out.  Herxheimer reactions can also occur with prescribed antibiotics.  When this herx got too strong for me to handle, I cut back on my monolaurin, and then started feeling pretty good.

Today, I took 8,000 iu of vitamin D3.  No brain fog or fatigue, just an improved mood.  I did finally get my D levels checked, I got a level of 13 ng/mL, so at least I know that my initial suspicion of a deficiency is confirmed.  Tomorrow morning I will try another 8,000 iu along with monolaurin again and see how things go.  I take today's experience as a good sign though, a few weeks ago I couldn't even function taking 1,000 iu.

TL/DR; Vitamin D3 was giving me fatigue and brain fog despite being in a deficient state, I suspected it might have been related to lyme disease, so I took monolaurin, which helps both lyme disease and chronic fatigue syndrome.  So far, I can tolerate much higher levels of vitamin D3 now without those side effects occurring.  If this method stops working for some reason, I will report back on that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all.

Disclaimer before i get extreme hate. 

Ibs Cure? Eh maybe, but longer remission? Absolutely. 

I am obviously very hesitant to say cure but there’s two ways to look at it from a mental aspect. 

I understand flares can happen, god forbid. 

To start off, i have had ibs for 21 years. After 13 years of running to the bathroom with pure watery diarrhea multiple times a day, multiple gastros that never took me seriously, we demanded a celiac panel test. I tested positive, did an endoscopy showing that my vilia were absolutely DESTROYED and that i have celiac disease. 

I went on a gluten free diet, sprouted up but dealt with my next issue that has ruined my life for the remainder of my years, snowballed into epilepsy, and who knows what else if I had not found something that is working. I don't mean just ruined. 

I mean fucking ruined. 

My irritable bullshit syndrome causes me to go 6-7 times a sitting maybe even more. The amount of poop that comes out of me, I simply can't even understand. I can't go fully therefore im wiping chunks of poop out of my ass. I'll wipe a couple times and more cramps come with even more shit. I can wipe 30 times and not be clean, then when i think i am...i have to go again.  It's a never ending cycle. Not only can I not stop going, i can't get clean. Id use up to 3-4 packs of (40) wipes a time. 

Finally depending ill eventually get “done” where my stomach will still hurt but im able to go through my day.  I take a shower after every time i feel i'm completely done as well if i have to go out after. 

I get scared i will get leakage, my cramps kill me, the holding gas in all day, I get extreme social anxiety, the whole nine yards despite spending 2 hours in the bathroom or more.  People without ibs wouldnt understand, and don't have my whole life.  I'd be late to school every morning and my grades dropped as I couldn't focus and was too tired to do anything. I'd be late to anything really. Id cancel so much also if somehow I was able to have plans. 

My 8th grade i gave up, my parents aren't supporting me and said you’ll never be clean its normal.  They refused to buy me wipes. I had shit in my underwear everyday thinking its normal.  Id have kids tell me to kill myself because i smelt like shit. I had no friends.  I thought of suicide every day, literally fucking bawling my eyes out when i got home.  

Wiping my ass has literally become an addiction a never ending anxiety looping roller coaster. This isn't a troll article, its my literal life so if you think im kidding...im glad you get a hilarious jerk off laugh from this. 

I've gone through over 20 gastros, plus over handfuls of pcps.  I got prescribed antidepressants as all of them told me its in my head, anxiety, it's just ibs, im perfectly fine. Endoscopies haven't shown anything, stool tests, yadda yadda.  The only thing i tested positive for was sibo and the gastro just said go lactose free/low fodmap diet.   The low fodmap helped with gas tremendously, however i know this is not sustainable and my diet has an extremely minimal selection.  Otherwise docs looked at me as a hypochondriac and a maniac as I still wasn’t doinf well

Take more fiber, take probiotics, eat more fiber, eat this, eat more vegetables.  Take this laxative, that steroid, i can't even fathom the things i've been told over and over that just made me simply worse. 

It's all in your head, you need a therapist, do yoga, meditate. Other than yoga (lol) i have done it all. 

I went to a homeopathic doctor and had to get homeschooled the latter of my senior year because I couldn't get out of bed. She fucked me up bad. 

Ive prolonged going to college because my health has been that fucking shitty and i dont want to waste 100k on loans, not yet at least. No pun intended. 

Now onto the stuff that im probably going to be flamed for and told that i'm a jackass it doesnt work its not a cure or whatever that i'm not thinking currently...

I've done research my whole life, ive wasted thousands of dollars on supplements, ive been lied to/cheated on in relationships, haven't always had the best support. I've done the meditation like i said all that junk. I've cut dairy, ive cut gluten, i've gone vegan, damn near all of it.  What it had seemed at least.  I've done low fodmap. 

Some of it made me incredibly worse. . 

I've taken probiotics.  Had EXPLOSIVE diarrhea.  I went through that for a week to get used to it. I gave up as I progressively got worse. 

One of the BEST gastros 2 hours away said try it again take VSL which is a prescribed incredibly high dosage of different strains of probiotics. 
I felt absolutely horrible.  The cramps, the pain, the trips to the bathroom, I went a full month thinking it can't be that. I quit I Couldn't anymore. 

My most recent gastro put me on multiple different fibers, i was put on viberzi, then a “safe” laxative, after those didn't work she wanted to go down the regular laxative route, I refused and she said basically that if you don't want to take the treatment then i can't do anything for you. 

I haven't gone back since and as of right now don’t have a gastro.  

I became depressed, more and more, irritable, suicidal, plain sad.  

I'm sure you know the feeling of having to put on a mask all the time, even to your parents, you don't want anyone to know how suicidal you are at times. 

For some reason I fight still. I don't know why. I'm not a religious person but I believe im here for a reason.  There's gotta be a reason for all of this. 
I'm not the only one that deals with this, and there's so much to learn.  Someone has got to. 

I've tried what seemed like everything. 

Until I noticed one thing after another starting helping more and more. Currently I spend no more than 20 minutes in the bathroom throughout the day and I mostly barely have to wipe at all. I feel completely evacuated. 

I've never had even a day like this in my 21 years on this earth. So to have multiple is an achievement I'd never thought I would have.  On top of that I haven’t had to go on some wacky diet. 

Tell me it's not a cure, its placebo, tell me it wont work forever, tell me it will come back.  I dont give a fuck.  I will not let whatever irritable bullshit syndrome is control my life.  It could be a disease it could not be, we have no idea it is.  We just blame it on ourselves . 

I admit, there's so much “bro” science, so many hypotheses, we have to go with what currently makes the most sense, what possibly gives results. The studies that we may or may not have been given hope from. 

We are all different, yes, but that doesnt mean some things won't work for you if they work for me too. 

Here’s currently what is giving me the best results ...First I want to ackknowledge my low fodmap diet I ate to keep weight on. I went from eating a bowl of rice chex, some eggs if I have the energy to make them, 2 pb and js, and whatever my mom makes at dinner usually very low fodmap and almost no fiber. 

To whole grain cheerios which would kill me before, eggs, just had some french toast today...still expanding. 

I was able to have cold cuts, with mayo yesterday.  I am able to eat grass fed burgers, even unhealthier options to see if I could stand them, hot dogs, fritos, chips, what have you. 

Dinner i can eat nearly anything, ive stretched out to chickpea pasta, peas, carrots, fruits more vegetables, fish, higher fodmap dinner foods had some spicy mayo too..

The junk food/processed food is mostly just a test although I must admit I missed ruffles chips. 

I'm constantly trying to expand to see what I can withstand. Did this happen overnight? No. I’m not a doctor, I'm simply just another ibs sufferer that found some things that help me of course under my doctors supervision, building dosages up. 

I noticed if I miss certain supplement dosages as of right now my symptoms come back, not nearly as bad however. 

To the juicy part of what my supplement stack is and why i added them. 

What I've found is that studies have shown that over 50% (some say 80%) of ibs diagnosis are sibo or some sort of gut dysbiosis. 
 
We all know this can cause a slew of issues, I believe it compromising the immune system is a huge issue also. 

Here are the following supplements with brands that i take. 
I want to keep it short but hopefully i can point you in the right direction. 

Now remember that I felt better on a low fodmap diet, tested positive for sibo, and didnt do well with lactic acid based probiotics..here we go. 

Ginger 3grams Natures Way-
Ginger has many many benefits as we all know, nausea, anti inflammatory, digestion etc. 

The main reason i use it though is as a natural pro kinetic. 

It is a very potent prokinetic to help the migrating motor complex (MMC) work. Think of the MMC as a brush that sweeps through your small intestines to rid of undigested food particles that may feed bacteria, cause gas, constipation, sibo etc. 

I take ginger at three separate times a day. 1gram in the morning, lunch and dinner.  Make sure you drink enough water too.  Laying down after you take it immediately might give you heartburn.  Work your way up in doses, you may find 1-2 grams is good for you.  I wouldnt go higher than 4-5 grams 

Saccharomyces Boulardii + MOS by Jarrow Formulas. 1-3 Caps

Saccharomyces Boulardii is actually a beneficial yeast that does not colonize in the gut. It’s very hardy and does NOT get killed my stomach acid, or heat so no need to throw them in your fridge. I mainly take it to improve the immune system, aid my soil based probiotics and decrease the possibility of diarrhea.  Theres so much more to use it for but thats what got me into it and hooked. I will eventually update this book to include studies. You should ALWAYS take this when on antibiotics as it does not get killed and prevents the gut dysbiosis issues that may happen. 

Jarrows formula also has Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). They are critical in signaling immune cells and largely found on the surface of your intestines. This formula has S. boulardii with the added benefits of free-flowing MOS.* S. boulardii promotes the health of the intestinal tract, helps support beneficial microbiota in the intestinal ecosystem, and enhances immune function alone, while MOS assists by helping guard against the adhesion of microorganisms to epithelial cells in the intestines.  MOS kinda of tricks bad bacteria ie; candida into carrying them out instead of having the bacteria build up and stick onto your intestinal walls. 


Turkey tail 1 gram host defense 
Turkey Tail mushroom i largely use as a prebiotic and to supercharge the immune system.  Its packed with antioxidants etc but the main thing is the immune boosting properties and the fact that it can help the soil based probiotics is huge. 

Turkey tail is actually the first supplement i found i was starting to have some relief with. 

Primal earth soil probiotics 1 capsule by Amy Myers- For cost reasons i have tried klaire labs but I believe the coconut oil killed me. 

As stated earlier regular probiotics that are found in the small intestines destroyed me.  I steered away from probiotics until recently i came across soil based probiotics.  Soil based probiotics have a hardier seed like structure than lacto or bifido based probiotics and are able to survive the stomach acid, small intestines, hell we call the gut lol, and are able to provide benefits with lower cfus (colony forming units) than lacto based probiotics   

This is because of all the harsh conditions the soil based probiotics can live through.  You also don’t have to lock them in the fridge either.  The soil based probiotics also know when to stay in their safe state until the environment is safe as well. 

This works a lot better for sibo, and i noticed for me as they go straight to the large intestines and colon instead of adding gas to the fire in the small intestines of mine.  “According to Amy Myers”....

A 2-week double-blind clinical study of patients diagnosed with IBS demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms when treated with a soil-based probiotic. Since we know that about 80% of IBS patients are likely dealing with SIBO, soil-based probiotics are an effective way to alleviate your SIBO-related symptoms as well.

There’s three different strains but as i mentioned earlier i will update this post later, i want to get this out as fast as possible as i had some doubters.

Lastly 30,000ius Vitamin D3 DAILY

You heard me correctly. 30 thousand. I highly recommend reading the book called the optimal dosage by Judson Somerville.  You won’t regret it. 

I don’t want to go to in depth about the D3 as I highly recommend you read that book before supplementing. 

Hopefully this helped some people, i had to go through my personal story to build background ensuring i am not a troll.  I like i said will be updating I promise, but to get this out there for others that like to do their own research as well.  Who knows I may have some people give me anecdotal feedback who already use these singular one’s on their own.  Let me know if i have any errors, you have advice, etc.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this! 

Tldr; the supplements currently help me and my ibs story as well

Disclaimer; This was somewhat rushed, just remember that.  I hope I steered you in a possibly correct direction.  Any opinions, input good or bad is appreciated.

Edit; i take 900 mg magnesium glycinate daily","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to keep this short as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer before i get extreme hate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibs Cure? Eh maybe, but longer remission? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am obviously very hesitant to say cure but there’s two ways to look at it from a mental aspect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand flares can happen, god forbid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off, i have had ibs for 21 years. After 13 years of running to the bathroom with pure watery diarrhea multiple times a day, multiple gastros that never took me seriously, we demanded a celiac panel test. I tested positive, did an endoscopy showing that my vilia were absolutely DESTROYED and that i have celiac disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a gluten free diet, sprouted up but dealt with my next issue that has ruined my life for the remainder of my years, snowballed into epilepsy, and who knows what else if I had not found something that is working. I don&amp;#39;t mean just ruined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean fucking ruined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My irritable bullshit syndrome causes me to go 6-7 times a sitting maybe even more. The amount of poop that comes out of me, I simply can&amp;#39;t even understand. I can&amp;#39;t go fully therefore im wiping chunks of poop out of my ass. I&amp;#39;ll wipe a couple times and more cramps come with even more shit. I can wipe 30 times and not be clean, then when i think i am...i have to go again.  It&amp;#39;s a never ending cycle. Not only can I not stop going, i can&amp;#39;t get clean. Id use up to 3-4 packs of (40) wipes a time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally depending ill eventually get “done” where my stomach will still hurt but im able to go through my day.  I take a shower after every time i feel i&amp;#39;m completely done as well if i have to go out after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get scared i will get leakage, my cramps kill me, the holding gas in all day, I get extreme social anxiety, the whole nine yards despite spending 2 hours in the bathroom or more.  People without ibs wouldnt understand, and don&amp;#39;t have my whole life.  I&amp;#39;d be late to school every morning and my grades dropped as I couldn&amp;#39;t focus and was too tired to do anything. I&amp;#39;d be late to anything really. Id cancel so much also if somehow I was able to have plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 8th grade i gave up, my parents aren&amp;#39;t supporting me and said you’ll never be clean its normal.  They refused to buy me wipes. I had shit in my underwear everyday thinking its normal.  Id have kids tell me to kill myself because i smelt like shit. I had no friends.  I thought of suicide every day, literally fucking bawling my eyes out when i got home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiping my ass has literally become an addiction a never ending anxiety looping roller coaster. This isn&amp;#39;t a troll article, its my literal life so if you think im kidding...im glad you get a hilarious jerk off laugh from this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone through over 20 gastros, plus over handfuls of pcps.  I got prescribed antidepressants as all of them told me its in my head, anxiety, it&amp;#39;s just ibs, im perfectly fine. Endoscopies haven&amp;#39;t shown anything, stool tests, yadda yadda.  The only thing i tested positive for was sibo and the gastro just said go lactose free/low fodmap diet.   The low fodmap helped with gas tremendously, however i know this is not sustainable and my diet has an extremely minimal selection.  Otherwise docs looked at me as a hypochondriac and a maniac as I still wasn’t doinf well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take more fiber, take probiotics, eat more fiber, eat this, eat more vegetables.  Take this laxative, that steroid, i can&amp;#39;t even fathom the things i&amp;#39;ve been told over and over that just made me simply worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all in your head, you need a therapist, do yoga, meditate. Other than yoga (lol) i have done it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a homeopathic doctor and had to get homeschooled the latter of my senior year because I couldn&amp;#39;t get out of bed. She fucked me up bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive prolonged going to college because my health has been that fucking shitty and i dont want to waste 100k on loans, not yet at least. No pun intended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto the stuff that im probably going to be flamed for and told that i&amp;#39;m a jackass it doesnt work its not a cure or whatever that i&amp;#39;m not thinking currently...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done research my whole life, ive wasted thousands of dollars on supplements, ive been lied to/cheated on in relationships, haven&amp;#39;t always had the best support. I&amp;#39;ve done the meditation like i said all that junk. I&amp;#39;ve cut dairy, ive cut gluten, i&amp;#39;ve gone vegan, damn near all of it.  What it had seemed at least.  I&amp;#39;ve done low fodmap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it made me incredibly worse. . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken probiotics.  Had EXPLOSIVE diarrhea.  I went through that for a week to get used to it. I gave up as I progressively got worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the BEST gastros 2 hours away said try it again take VSL which is a prescribed incredibly high dosage of different strains of probiotics. 
I felt absolutely horrible.  The cramps, the pain, the trips to the bathroom, I went a full month thinking it can&amp;#39;t be that. I quit I Couldn&amp;#39;t anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent gastro put me on multiple different fibers, i was put on viberzi, then a “safe” laxative, after those didn&amp;#39;t work she wanted to go down the regular laxative route, I refused and she said basically that if you don&amp;#39;t want to take the treatment then i can&amp;#39;t do anything for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t gone back since and as of right now don’t have a gastro.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became depressed, more and more, irritable, suicidal, plain sad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you know the feeling of having to put on a mask all the time, even to your parents, you don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know how suicidal you are at times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I fight still. I don&amp;#39;t know why. I&amp;#39;m not a religious person but I believe im here for a reason.  There&amp;#39;s gotta be a reason for all of this. 
I&amp;#39;m not the only one that deals with this, and there&amp;#39;s so much to learn.  Someone has got to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried what seemed like everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I noticed one thing after another starting helping more and more. Currently I spend no more than 20 minutes in the bathroom throughout the day and I mostly barely have to wipe at all. I feel completely evacuated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had even a day like this in my 21 years on this earth. So to have multiple is an achievement I&amp;#39;d never thought I would have.  On top of that I haven’t had to go on some wacky diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me it&amp;#39;s not a cure, its placebo, tell me it wont work forever, tell me it will come back.  I dont give a fuck.  I will not let whatever irritable bullshit syndrome is control my life.  It could be a disease it could not be, we have no idea it is.  We just blame it on ourselves . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit, there&amp;#39;s so much “bro” science, so many hypotheses, we have to go with what currently makes the most sense, what possibly gives results. The studies that we may or may not have been given hope from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all different, yes, but that doesnt mean some things won&amp;#39;t work for you if they work for me too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s currently what is giving me the best results ...First I want to ackknowledge my low fodmap diet I ate to keep weight on. I went from eating a bowl of rice chex, some eggs if I have the energy to make them, 2 pb and js, and whatever my mom makes at dinner usually very low fodmap and almost no fiber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To whole grain cheerios which would kill me before, eggs, just had some french toast today...still expanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to have cold cuts, with mayo yesterday.  I am able to eat grass fed burgers, even unhealthier options to see if I could stand them, hot dogs, fritos, chips, what have you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner i can eat nearly anything, ive stretched out to chickpea pasta, peas, carrots, fruits more vegetables, fish, higher fodmap dinner foods had some spicy mayo too..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The junk food/processed food is mostly just a test although I must admit I missed ruffles chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly trying to expand to see what I can withstand. Did this happen overnight? No. I’m not a doctor, I&amp;#39;m simply just another ibs sufferer that found some things that help me of course under my doctors supervision, building dosages up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed if I miss certain supplement dosages as of right now my symptoms come back, not nearly as bad however. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the juicy part of what my supplement stack is and why i added them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve found is that studies have shown that over 50% (some say 80%) of ibs diagnosis are sibo or some sort of gut dysbiosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know this can cause a slew of issues, I believe it compromising the immune system is a huge issue also. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the following supplements with brands that i take. 
I want to keep it short but hopefully i can point you in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now remember that I felt better on a low fodmap diet, tested positive for sibo, and didnt do well with lactic acid based probiotics..here we go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginger 3grams Natures Way-
Ginger has many many benefits as we all know, nausea, anti inflammatory, digestion etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason i use it though is as a natural pro kinetic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a very potent prokinetic to help the migrating motor complex (MMC) work. Think of the MMC as a brush that sweeps through your small intestines to rid of undigested food particles that may feed bacteria, cause gas, constipation, sibo etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take ginger at three separate times a day. 1gram in the morning, lunch and dinner.  Make sure you drink enough water too.  Laying down after you take it immediately might give you heartburn.  Work your way up in doses, you may find 1-2 grams is good for you.  I wouldnt go higher than 4-5 grams &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saccharomyces Boulardii + MOS by Jarrow Formulas. 1-3 Caps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saccharomyces Boulardii is actually a beneficial yeast that does not colonize in the gut. It’s very hardy and does NOT get killed my stomach acid, or heat so no need to throw them in your fridge. I mainly take it to improve the immune system, aid my soil based probiotics and decrease the possibility of diarrhea.  Theres so much more to use it for but thats what got me into it and hooked. I will eventually update this book to include studies. You should ALWAYS take this when on antibiotics as it does not get killed and prevents the gut dysbiosis issues that may happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarrows formula also has Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). They are critical in signaling immune cells and largely found on the surface of your intestines. This formula has S. boulardii with the added benefits of free-flowing MOS.* S. boulardii promotes the health of the intestinal tract, helps support beneficial microbiota in the intestinal ecosystem, and enhances immune function alone, while MOS assists by helping guard against the adhesion of microorganisms to epithelial cells in the intestines.  MOS kinda of tricks bad bacteria ie; candida into carrying them out instead of having the bacteria build up and stick onto your intestinal walls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey tail 1 gram host defense 
Turkey Tail mushroom i largely use as a prebiotic and to supercharge the immune system.  Its packed with antioxidants etc but the main thing is the immune boosting properties and the fact that it can help the soil based probiotics is huge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey tail is actually the first supplement i found i was starting to have some relief with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primal earth soil probiotics 1 capsule by Amy Myers- For cost reasons i have tried klaire labs but I believe the coconut oil killed me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier regular probiotics that are found in the small intestines destroyed me.  I steered away from probiotics until recently i came across soil based probiotics.  Soil based probiotics have a hardier seed like structure than lacto or bifido based probiotics and are able to survive the stomach acid, small intestines, hell we call the gut lol, and are able to provide benefits with lower cfus (colony forming units) than lacto based probiotics   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because of all the harsh conditions the soil based probiotics can live through.  You also don’t have to lock them in the fridge either.  The soil based probiotics also know when to stay in their safe state until the environment is safe as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works a lot better for sibo, and i noticed for me as they go straight to the large intestines and colon instead of adding gas to the fire in the small intestines of mine.  “According to Amy Myers”....&lt;/p&gt;

Since the B vitamins have great synergy together, I'd like to eat tons of food which is rich in B vitamins (leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, eggs, maybe some meat).

&lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate will add water weight along with the benefits 
but 
Creatine hydrochloride will just hydrate my muscles without adding the extra pounds along with the extra benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been taking GAT SPORT's Testrol GOLD ES for about 3 weeks now, last night I encountered my first ever wet dream. 

Since taking them, I've felt really good in all aspects this natural ""Test Booster"" claims, Gym, Daily and intimate life situations.

Just curious since even in puberty (mine was about 12-14 or 15 years old) I don't think I've ever had a wet dream and I know this has to be my first one. At 23 I thought it was definitely just a little bit delayed, right? Doesn't bother me, I'm not in any discomfort, just more so curious that it actually happened. Could the supplement be working as intended?

After reading and posting here for a while, I assembled the following stack. Can you check if anything is wrong (I.e. bad interactions, timing) or missing?
Please tell me also if you spot any overlap between supplements.

Thanks!

**BEFORE BREAKFAST**

* Black seed oil
* Cordyceps (cycled with ginseng and rhodiola)
* Taurine 

**AFTER BREAKFAST**

* Krill oil
* Boron
* Probiotics 

**BEFORE LUNCH**

* Taurine

**AFTER LUNCH**

* Krill oil
* Boron
* Probiotics 
* B complex
* Vit D3 + K2

**BEFORE DINNER**

* Black seed oil
* Taurine

**AFTER DINNER**

* Glycine (I’m considering switching to collagen and take it in the morning before breakfast, since I have dry skin issues and it seems to be more complete) 
* Magnesium 


A few questions:

* for free testosterone is boron 3mg x 2 okay or is it better 9mg total? Is it necessary to add zinc as well?

* since boron, cordyceps (and I think also taurine) are supposed to increase testosterone, should I add an anti-aromatase, such as resveratrol or grape seed extract?

* how much cordyceps? ATM I’m taking 1500mg before breakfast

* is it okay to take a B complex after lunch, or it’s too stimulatory, considering that I’m also taking cordyceps? I’d like to try B complex, since I’m coming off caffeine (ATM I’m drinking only one coffee with breakfast)

* NAC could be useful in my stack?

* anybody has experience with jiaogulan/gynostemma?

* should I add something for dopamine? Ginkgo?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi folks,&lt;/p&gt;

My weight is 78 (171 pounds) and height is 173 (almost 5”9) 

Anyway this is what I bought 

Dymatize ISO 
Muscletech- glutamine
CLA
BCAA
OPTIMEN ( multi vitamin I believe )
Creatine
And a pre workout called MP ASSAULT

I train about 3-4 times a week
And haven’t taken any of these yet but I would like to know what should I or what should I not take

ISO 2 times a day after breakfast and 2nd time mixed with glutamine after workout 

Creatine mixed with pre workout 20 minutes before the workout 

BCAA throughout the workout

Multi vitamins 1 time a day

Anything else that may help? 

150 grams of protein, 200 grams of carbs, 110 grams of fat seem to be the macros that reduce hunger the most for me. Also getting between 60 to 80 grams of fiber. No vitamin deficiencies to show for on my blood work. 

Longer Version: 

I'm losing 1 pound a week for 8 weeks so that I can finally get down to 10 percent body fat.

I know this isnt a lot of weight to lose, but I become an irritable, lazy, overwhelmed piece of human garbage whenever I'm on a caloric deficit. (But that's probably evidence that I'm not exactly a saint when I'm eating to maintenance)

I've tried and failed to lose these last 8 pounds before because I feel too overwhelmed by the hunger and fatigue, so I eventually just say ""fuck it"" and give up. 

Part of what makes this difficult is that I have a day job where I'm pretty active, and I'm a performing/occasionally touring musician, so I run into situations where I'm working Monday-Friday then have nearly overnight shows + drives Friday through Sunday. 

Luckily, I dont have any shows that far away for the next 2 months, so this is probably the perfect time to so this. 

With that being said, I still have a lot of trouble finding the motivation just to practice or write music after work when I'm on a caloric deficit,  and taking caffeine or IR adderall later in the day can make it difficult for me to sleep 


Losing the weight at a slower rate didnt seem to help, so now my plan is to just get in, lose the weight, get out, and enjoy eating to maintenance/slightly above maintenance on hard workout days.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Looking for suggestions to reduce hunger and fatigue on caloric deficit.

&lt;p&gt;I know this isnt a lot of weight to lose, but I become an irritable, lazy, overwhelmed piece of human garbage whenever I&amp;#39;m on a caloric deficit. (But that&amp;#39;s probably evidence that I&amp;#39;m not exactly a saint when I&amp;#39;m eating to maintenance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried and failed to lose these last 8 pounds before because I feel too overwhelmed by the hunger and fatigue, so I eventually just say &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes this difficult is that I have a day job where I&amp;#39;m pretty active, and I&amp;#39;m a performing/occasionally touring musician, so I run into situations where I&amp;#39;m working Monday-Friday then have nearly overnight shows + drives Friday through Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I dont have any shows that far away for the next 2 months, so this is probably the perfect time to so this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I still have a lot of trouble finding the motivation just to practice or write music after work when I&amp;#39;m on a caloric deficit,  and taking caffeine or IR adderall later in the day can make it difficult for me to sleep &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing the weight at a slower rate didnt seem to help, so now my plan is to just get in, lose the weight, get out, and enjoy eating to maintenance/slightly above maintenance on hard workout days.&lt;/p&gt;

I know you all won't believe me probably, but I still want to share this just in case someone else might find it interesting/useful.

Both times this happened, I only used about 2.5g of creatine monohydrate from a good brand, no additives mentioned on the label, first time two days in a row, the next time just one day. The effect was noticeable in about a couple of hours and reached its peak on day 2-3 after last dose, then slowly wearing off. That shit was out of control, the restlesslessness, the energy, the insanely good mood, and racing thoughts. I nearly ended up hospitalized and now I'm diagnosed as Bipolar. 

I don't blame creatine for that, I looked back on my life and realized that's been the case for quite a while, but I didn't realize before that depressions weren't my only problem. If it hadn't been for this, I might have never figured out those other periods were destructive for me and were in fact hypomanias, just not as wild as the one I had on creatine. 

Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of studies done on this, and I know some bipolar people take creatine with no issue, but for some reason in my case, it's a bad, bad reaction IMMEDIATELY, not after three weeks like in a study I found on supplementing creatine in depressed people, two of whom were bipolar. Also, creatine kinase levels were found to be elevated in bipolar patients going through hypomania/mania in another study (no supplementation). I don't know what this means, and if my reaction was exacerbated by caffeine (not at the same time, but the same day; I'm a dumbass).

I found on ConsumerLab a study of  bioavailability  curcumin formulations made by themselves. 

\- https://www.consumerlab.com/news/turmeric-and-curcumin/04-04-2017/

the same here  :

\- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006023

Maybe you know what I'm talking about, if not , watch  here , will be interesting.

Based on the literature search, 11 curcumin formulations with available human bioavailability and pharmacokinetics data were included in this review. Further, the data on clinical study design, analytical method, pharmacokinetic parameters and other relevant details of each formulation were extracted.

Based on a review of these studies, it's evident that better bioavailability of formulated curcumin products is mostly attributed to improved solubility, stability, and possibly low first-pass metabolism. The review hopes to provide a quick reference guide for anyone looking information on these bioavailable curcumin formulations.

Based on the published reports we have :

\-NovaSol = 185 x

\- Curcuwin =136 x

\- Longvida = 100 x

\- Meriva = 48 x

\- BCM 95 = 27 x 

\- C3 complex +bioperine = 20 x

\- Theracurmin = 16 x 

So , I considered the most frequently used brands by myself . Prices from Amazon .

Basically, the capsules are formed from : the active part + improvement  additives .

I noted SC =  standard curcumin bioavailable in the body (free curcumin + metabolites)

I did the math  :

\-1 capsule NovaSol = 750 mg ,active substance = 40mg x 185 = 7.4 grams SC

Full spectrum curcumin from Solgar, 30 gels ; 22.49 $ ; 0.75$ /gel ; 0.75 $/7.4 = **1gr. SC = 0.11 $**

\- 1capsule Curcuwin = 250 mg , active substance 20% = 50 mg x 136 = 6.8 grams SC

Relentless Improvement CurcuWin , 60 capsules ; 26.95 $ ; 0.45$ /capsule; 0.45 $ /6.8= **1gr.SC=0.07 $**

\- 1 capsule Longvida = 400 mg , active substance 20 % = 80 mg x 100 = 8  grams SC

NOW Supplements,Curcubrain , 50 capsules ; 33.70 $ ; 0.68$ /capsule ; 0.68 $ /8 = **1 gr. SC = 0.09 $**

\- 1 capsule Meriva =500 mg ,active substance 18-22%  = 100mg = 0.1 grams x 47 = 4.7 grams SC

Jarrow Formulas Curcumin Phytosome, 60 caps. ; 13.12 $ ; 0.22$ /capsule; 0.22$ /4.7 =**1gr. SC = 0.05 $**

\- 1 capsule BCM 95 = 400 mg ,active substance =380mg = 0.380 grams x 27 = 10.26 grams SC

Life Extension SuperBio Curcumin ,60 caps. ; 21.79 $ ; 0.37$ /capsule ; 0.37 $ /10.26 = **1gr. SC =**  **0.04 $**

\- 1 capsule C3 Complex = 500 mg ,active substance = 475mg = 0.475 grams x 20 = 9.5 grams SC

Turmeric Curcumin C3 Complex SR , 120 caps. ; 21.64 $ ; 0.18$ /capsule; 0.18 $ /9.5 = **1gr. SC = 0.02 $**

**-** 1 capsule  Theracurmin = 600mg , active substance = 60mg = 0.06 grams x 16 = 0.96 grams SC

CurcuminRich Theracurmin , 60 capsules ; 38.47 $ ; 0.65 $/capsule ; 0.65 $ /0.96 = **1gr. SC = 0.68 $**

What about that ?... Before drawing the conclusions we must consider :

1.  The  bioavailability  is not the same with the time of staying in the body , otherwise it would mean that C3 Complex is more bioavailable than Theracurmin. Absurd.

2. The bioavailability doesn't reflect the medical potency of the product. Show me a cancer trial with Curcuwin.

3. The bioavailability doesn't influence the specific medical properties of a curcumin formulation. Being a sick man I noticed the different effects of different formulations .

4. The bioavailability differs very much with each brand for the same formulation . I'm convinced that each of you noticed this.

5. Some prices are insanely and by no mean  practically justified.

I would love some advice about when and how is best to take all these supplements to get the best from them.

(Please note: I'm only listing my supplements below, not my prescribed meds. I get that my meds and my ailments can affect the efficacy of supplements and vice versa, but for now I'd really appreciate some advice based just on the supplements.)

My current day:

**First thing**

Berberine extract 400mg

Oregano Oil 500mg

**About 11 a.m.**

Big bowl of plain Greek yoghurt 

Lactase tablet

Vit. K2 75ug

D3 2000iu

1000mg magnesium glycinate/lysinate

**About 7 p.m.**

Meal, if I have one at all -- I'm trying to get better about it -- involving the few things I can eat 

Vit. B6 100mg

Folic Acid 400ug

Digestive enzymes

B12 75ug

Chorella &amp; Spirulina tablets - 5 or so, more when the meal contained little or no protein.

In between times I snack on dry oatcakes (much nicer than they sound). I drink only water.

I've just got the following, but am not sure when best to take them. Don't yet know if I can tolerate them either, often I can't:

Krill oil 500mg

5-htp with l-tryptophan 400 mg

I also have vitamin C in a couple of forms, which I feel sure I should be taking, but I find it very hard to tolerate.


Edit: To try to be super clear, I'm not after advice about which supplements to take. I've already had plenty of that. It's when in the day it's best to take them and in what combinations. I'd be very grateful for this kind of advice. Many thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently on a very restrictive diet for a mix of food intolerance and medical reasons and am trying to supplement to at least take the edge off the malnutrition I seem to be constantly flirting with.

I&amp;#39;ve found many threads saying &amp;quot;fluoride doesn&amp;#39;t cause any harm&amp;quot; but none from people who have actually tried filtering it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone add minerals or other dilute supplements to their daily drinking water, and have noticed positive results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common wisdom seems to be that tap water is &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;, but I wonder if there is a better water, and what that might be. There is lots of woo and arguments-against-woo, so hard to find plausible personal accounts of benefits. Particularly interested in anecdotal personal experiences that indicate if any of these has a perceptible benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm interested in the science of human aging. I've seen many interesting studies such as those which involve high dose vitamins like D or C in different scenarios (refusing chemotherapy, lifespan in animals). Then there are those which suggest butyrates produced by the gut can protect against M.S there are too many to list here. 

Vitamin K2 is also a microbially derived compound. K1 from healthful foods like kale. K2 is being studied now to be of importance for protecting against cancers, CKD, and helpful for processing  vitamin D3 in higher doses. Vitamin E on the other hand is thought to be dangerous at high doses for longer periods of time. It may be possible that this is due to its antagonistic effect on vitamin K2.

Today I was reading on a study involving vitamin E and asthma and this was striking:  ""In unpublished studies from our research group, lung inflammation in response to OVA was also reduced by administration of α-tocopherol through the diet and elevated by administration of γ-tocopherol through the diet, using a diets supplemented with 250 mg α- or γ-tocopherol /kg diet.""

So someone 100 kgs would take 250*100=25000/100=25g in this scenario. 400iu is about 0.6mg, so if you take 4 400iu pills you're just under 1 gram. So let me think like 100 of those shoprite vitamin E capsules a day. Now it would be extremely dangerous, but I've never encountered anything like this and I wanted to back it up online.

After stopping Selenium for 3 or 4 days I can say my stiff leg feeling has reduced by 70% and i can actually walk normally now without pain.
It is as if that supplement caused some kind of nerve damage or something.
However my tinnitus hasn’t changed at all, it may have even got worse?

I had started getting panic attacks. Read to try magnesium and I did. Boom. Anxiety mostly gone surprisingly. Took magnesium in a high dose for 2 years at like 650mg a day. Taking calcium too I think in milk (cashew milk so it was added).

Magnesium started giving me adverse effects so I stopped taking it. No problem, I wasn’t having anxiety anymore. Fast forward to now. It’s been a year or two. I noticed that calcium and magnesium both affected me in weird ways. I know they balance each other out. They both caused me different types of anxiety when I took either. 

Now, I’m athletic but started taking a BJJ class lately. So I lift 3x a week, BJJ 3-4x a week for 2 hours each, and also surf a lot. 

I’m very active and started getting muscle twitches and cramps. I knew something was up. Before t was my magnesium so I tried supplementing again to stop the twitches. This just made me get anxiety and panic. I was down for a few days and lost libido. Anxiety and negative thoughts. 

I thought maybe it’s my calcium and I drank some. I picked myself up and did feel better actually. It worked. This was earlier this week. Well today I got another twitch. I drank some milk from the bottle. 10 minutes my twitch went away. 20-30 minutes later. Bad panic attack. Heart racing. I honestly felt “manic” in a way which is prob just the anxiety. I was getting a ton of work done, making calls before I started getting anxious and all these feelings. I got hyperhydrosis and just a lot of physical symptoms. Shaking bad.

I got some magnesium and took some. Now I’m in bed and feel A LOT better. 


Wtf is wrong with me? I honestly always felt a difference with calcium and magnesium, don’t know why. The weeks during BJJ and even before. I just didn’t take milk or magnesium and felt fine. It wasn’t until I started getting muscle twitches that I decided to start getting more of those in me. 

What do you guys recommend me doing? A lot of people say just supplement magnesium, but it feels like I need a perfect balance? 

Before this recently, I don’t get panic attacks a lot. It seems it only happens when I’m low in calcium or magnesium or oversupplemented one. My anxiety is like 5-10% and not that bad.


What can I do? ALSO, Vitamin D (when ever I’ve tried taking a D3 supplement, has haven me anxiety). Though I’ve only taken it like 5 times maybe because each time I get the same kind of anxiety I do when too much calcium or magnesium.


Edit: going to talk to a doctor. In the meantime. I’m going to lay off any supplements and keep training. Will get a bit of calcium from natural sources (instead of almond milk which has added calcium), so dairy.

Do I have everything for the Calcium and the Vitamin D3 to be absorbed? As far as I understand D3 helps the absorption of Calcium, K1/K2 help the absorption of D3 and Magnesium helps with the absorption of both Calcium and D3.
